Therefore, we would appreciate it if you timely update your RSVPs in case you sign up but cannot finally make it; we would also ask that you check-in with me (alf) when you arrive, so we can keep track of attendance. We'll try to keep the hassle to a minimum, but also want to ensure that as few spots as possible are left empty because of people signing up but not showing to the meetup while there are still people in the wait-list.</p> <p>Aside from this, I \\u00a0might not be able to make it to every weekly meetup (I'll RSVP 'no' if so); in that case, I'm sure that Isle of Gamers staff will be able to assist you with any questions.</p> <p>Finally, don't forget to spend some money at some point, to support Isle of Gamers! It's all they ask in return for offering us the space and demo game library for our meetups! They have a nice offer of drinks and snacks and, of course, an awesome selection of boardgames for us geeks to spend our money on! ;D</p> <p>_______________________________________________</p> <p>[from Isle of Gamers management:]</p> <p>This is a regular weekly meetup to play any number of the games available in our Game Library.

If you want to visit this place with your friends and family, you can always do so outside of this Meetup event.</p> <p>The admission fees are:<br/>Adult: $22<br/>Senior: $18 (65 years and older)<br/>Student/Teacher/Military: $15 (with valid ID)</p> <p>Built more than sixty years after the California Gold Rush which inspired massive migration to Northern California, and ten years after the devastating 1906 earthquake and fires in San Francisco, Filoli (pronounced \\u201cFie-low-lee\\u201d) represented a desire to create a magnificent and enduring country estate. its eclecticism reflects a Golden Age in California\\u2019s history, free from the conventional rules of design, and exuding a pride in creativity and expression.</p> <p>Filoli was built for Mr. and Mrs. William Bowers Bourn II, prominent San Franciscans at the turn of the twentieth century. Mr. Bourn arrived at the unusual name Filoli by combining the first two letters from the key words of his personal credo: \\u201cFIght for a just cause; LOve your fellow man; LIve a good life.\\u201d</p> <p>Construction of Filoli began in 1915, and the Bourns moved into the House in 1917. Filoli\\u2019s extensive formal garden was bult between 1917 and 1929. Both Mr. and Mrs. Bourn died in 1936.</p> <p>In 1937, the estate was purchased by Mr. and Mrs. William P. Roth, owners of the San-Francisco-based Matson Navigation Company. Under the Roths\\u2019 supervision, the property was maintained, and the formal garden gained worldwide recognition. Mrs. Roth made Filoli her home until 1975, when she donated the House and formal garden to the National Trust for Historic Preservation, for the enjoyment and inspiration of future generations.<br/>The remaining acreage was later given to Filoli Center. For more than forty years, the two nonprofits have co-stewarded the historic estate.</p> <p>HOW TO MEETUP: Let\\u2019s meet inside the ticket center from you which you\\u2019ll enter this gorgeous estate. It\\u2019ll take some time for everyone to get ticketed, so we\\u2019ll start our tour at around 10:15AM. We'll divide our group into a smaller group of four, so we can all be together with someone from the group but not have to worry about getting strayed from the group.</p> <p>We will all regroup at the center at around 1:00pm to have lunch/snack together at their garden cafe.</p> <p>CAR POOL: If you want to carpool with other members, indicate that in your comment when you sign up.

Whether covering the three-ring circus of a vicious presidential race, plunging into the wars between dictionary writers, or confronting the World's Largest Lobster Cooker at the annual Maine Lobster Festival, Wallace projects a quality of thought that is uniquely his and a voice as powerful and distinct as any in American letters.</p> <p>PLEASE BRING LOTS OF SWEETS AND PARTY HATS SO WE CAN CELEBRATE CASSIE'S BIRTHDAY!!!</p> \", \"visibility\": \"public\"}, {\"created\": 1506536999000, \"duration\": 788400000, \"id\": \"243717539\", \"name\": \"Travel to Turkey!\", \"status\": \"upcoming\", \"time\": 1526090400000, \"local_date\": \"2018-05-11\", \"local_time\": \"19:00\", \"updated\": 1520916836000, \"utc_offset\": -25200000, \"waitlist_count\": 0, \"yes_rsvp_count\": 1, \"venue\": {\"id\": 25568193, \"name\": \"Hagia Sophia\", \"lat\": 0.0, \"lon\": 0.0, \"repinned\": false, \"address_1\": \"Sultan Ahmet Mahallesi, Ayasofya Meydan\\u0131, 34122 Fatih\", \"city\": \"Istanbul\", \"country\": \"tr\", \"localized_country_name\": \"Turkey\"}, \"group\": {\"created\": 1250982993000, \"name\": \"30-44 Yrs Old for Adventures, Friendships & Fun\", \"id\": 1511048, \"join_mode\": \"open\", \"lat\": 37.400001525878906, \"lon\": -122.01000213623047, \"urlname\": \"30s40sMRP\", \"who\": \"explorers\", \"localized_location\": \"Sunnyvale, CA\", \"region\": \"en_US\"}, \"link\": \"https://www.meetup.com/30s40sMRP/events/243717539/\", \"description\": \"<p>Turkey Trip!

The key challenges faced by real-world apps and our solution approach, specifically around expressive query arguments, access control, schema iteration, sharing auth between multiple API backends. We will also review some quick tips to make the most out of Postgres and reveal some early performance benchmarks. We will end with a demo how you can create complex data models and make intuitive graphql queries from your app without requiring in-depth knowledge of graphql schemas.</p> <p>Vamshi heads engineering at Hasura. He was instrumental in building the GraphQL data layer at Hasura. Vamshi's latest work at Hasura is setting up a declarative infrastructure provisioning system.</p> <p>-----<br/>Speaker: Preeti<br/>Title: Building CorvoStore, an in-memory, key-value database</p> <p>Description:<br/>\\\"How does Redis work? Why is it so efficient and popular?\\\"<br/>In order to answer these questions, I collaborated with two other developers to create CorvoStore, a Key-value store inspired by Redis, that meets the same time-complexity benchmarks for operations on its stored values.<br/>In my presentation I will talk about using:<br/>\\u2014A hash and doubly-linked list to represent Least-Recently-Used (LRU) key expiration<br/>\\u2014Redis-inspired RESP protocol,<br/>\\u2014The engineering process of building a node-based, key-value store from scratch\\\"</p> <p>Preeti is a fullstack developer interested in learning new technologies and discovering what is happening in the JS community.</p> <p>----<br/>We are excited to see you all in May!

Alan Stern and David Grinspoon will give a free, illustrated, non-technical talk on:</p> <p>\\\"CHASING NEW HORIZONS: INSIDE THE EPIC FIRST MISSION TO PLUTO\\\"</p> <p>in the Smithwick Theater at Foothill College, in Los Altos.</p> <p>The talk is part of the Silicon Valley Astronomy Lecture Series at Foothill College, now in its 18th year.</p> <p>In July 2015, humanity's fastest spacecraft, \\\"New Horizons,\\\" flew by Pluto, revealing details of its surprisingly active surface and atmosphere for the first time. Come hear the mission's Principal Investigator, Alan Stern, and noted planetary scientist and author, David Grinspoon, discuss their unique, insider's view of how we got to Pluto and what we discovered there. Learn about the hazy layers of smog in Pluto's air, the mysterious ocean-like feature called Sputnik, the towering mountains made of solid ice, and much more. The evening will include a preview of the mission's next flyby, in 2019, of a remote member of the Kuiper Belt of icy remnants from the birth of our solar system.</p> <p>After the talk, there will be a book signing for Stern and Grinspoon's new book Chasing New Horizons (2018, Picador Books.)</p> <p>Dr. Alan Stern, trained both as an engineer and as an astrophysicist, was the science leader of New Horizons, and has been involved with over 20 other space missions. He was Associate Administrator at NASA for science missions and was twice named to Time Magazine's list of the 100 most influential people. He has been the author or editor of six books for the public and has won numerous prizes for his work, including the Carl Sagan Memorial Award.</p> <p>Dr. David Grinspoon is an astrobiologist, and an award-winning author and public speaker. He held the inaugural chair of astrobiology at the Library of Congress and has been on the science team for several planetary missions. His books include The Earth in Human Hands and Venus Revealed.</p> <p>The lecture is co-sponsored by:</p> <p>The Foothill College Astronomy Program<br/>The Astronomical Society of the Pacific<br/>The SETI Institute<br/>NASA's Ames Research Center</p> <p>Past lectures in the series can be found on YouTube at www.youtube.com/SVAstronomyLectures.</p> <p>NOTE this talk is on a Tuesday, whereas all the other lectures in this series have been Wednesdays!</p> <p>The event is free, but there is a charge of $3 for parking on campus and exact change is appreciated.</p> <p>Foothill College is just off the El Monte Road exit from Freeway 280 in Los Altos.

About a third of the park, the south side of the creek, allows dogs off leash if they play well with others (dogs and people) and come when called. If you haven\\u2019t been to Stulsaft Park, it is definitely worth checking out. Not only great for the dogs, but gorgeous scenery for a short hike or run.</p> <p>- <a href=\\\"https://www.yelp.com/biz/stulsaft-park-redwood-city\\\" class=\\\"linkified\\\">https://www.yelp.com/biz/stulsaft-park-redwood-city</a></p> <p>- <a href=\\\"http://www.redwoodcity.org/departments/parks-recreation-and-community-services/parks/dog-parks/stulsaft-park-off-leash-area\\\" class=\\\"linkified\\\">http://www.redwoodcity.org/departments/parks-recreation-and-community-services/parks/dog-parks/stulsaft-park-off-leash-area</a></p> <p>We will meet at the Farm Hill Blvd entrance (one of four entrances but the entrance with the easiest parking and easiest to find), just inside the gate on the right side of the kids' play area. The walk will be about 2 miles for us, and your dog can run as many miles as he/she wants playing with other dogs, chasing squirrels/birds, or wading through the creek as you and he/she desire. The path will be to walk our dogs on leash down a hill, past the field and across the bridge (about 5 minute stroll) to the off leash area. There is a big play area by the creek where dogs can run and chase each other or play fetch if that\\u2019s what they enjoy. We also can take the mile or so loop trail in the off leash part of Stulsaft Park through the woods with dogs running free. There are some hills so be ready for a little work out for us too and have shoes/sneakers with decent traction.</p> <p>Feel free to come if you don\\u2019t have a dog as well. Meandering through the woods with dogs around can be a great way to relax after a long work day.</p> <p>I attached some photos to give a feel for the park. Yes, most include my handsome Australian shepherd puppy, Leo.</p> \", \"visibility\": \"public\"}, {\"link\": \"https://www.meetup.com/Make-New-Friends-in-the-Bay/events/242966373/\", \"visibility\": \"public_limited\", \"group\": {\"created\": 1361411618000, \"name\": \"Make New Friends - 20-40s/all\", \"id\": 7277952, \"join_mode\": \"approval\", \"lat\": 37.33000183105469, \"lon\": -121.79000091552734, \"urlname\": \"Make-New-Friends-in-the-Bay\", \"who\": \"Friends\", \"localized_location\": \"San Jose, CA\", \"region\": \"en_US\"}, \"waitlist_count\": 0, \"yes_rsvp_count\": 6, \"duration\": 7200000, \"time\": 1526230800000, \"utc_offset\": -25200000, \"name\": \"Casual + friendly + co-ed ultimate frisbee (beginners welcome!)\", \"id\": \"bvsqqpyxhbrb\"}, {\"link\": \"https://www.meetup.com/Make-New-Friends-in-the-Bay/events/242966380/\", \"visibility\": \"public_limited\", \"group\": {\"created\": 1361411618000, \"name\": \"Make New Friends - 20-40s/all\", \"id\": 7277952, \"join_mode\": \"approval\", \"lat\": 37.33000183105469, \"lon\": -121.79000091552734, \"urlname\": \"Make-New-Friends-in-the-Bay\", \"who\": \"Friends\", \"localized_location\": \"San Jose, CA\", \"region\": \"en_US\"}, \"waitlist_count\": 0, \"yes_rsvp_count\": 5, \"duration\": 7200000, \"time\": 1527440400000, \"utc_offset\": -25200000, \"name\": \"Casual + friendly + co-ed ultimate frisbee (beginners welcome!)\", \"id\": \"bvsqqpyxhbkc\"}, {\"link\": \"https://www.meetup.com/Make-New-Friends-in-the-Bay/events/243599572/\", \"visibility\": \"public_limited\", \"group\": {\"created\": 1361411618000, \"name\": \"Make New Friends - 20-40s/all\", \"id\": 7277952, \"join_mode\": \"approval\", \"lat\": 37.33000183105469, \"lon\": -121.79000091552734, \"urlname\": \"Make-New-Friends-in-the-Bay\", \"who\": \"Friends\", \"localized_location\": \"San Jose, CA\", \"region\": \"en_US\"}, \"waitlist_count\": 0, \"yes_rsvp_count\": 5, \"duration\": 7200000, \"time\": 1528045200000, \"utc_offset\": -25200000, \"name\": \"Casual + friendly + co-ed ultimate frisbee (beginners welcome!)\", \"id\": \"bvsqqpyxjbfb\"}, {\"created\": 1524356755000, \"duration\": 7200000, \"id\": \"250021342\", \"name\": \"Ladies High Tea ($30 includes tax and tip)\", \"rsvp_limit\": 1, \"status\": \"upcoming\", \"time\": 1526857200000, \"local_date\": \"2018-05-20\", \"local_time\": \"16:00\", \"rsvp_close_offset\": \"PT168H\", \"updated\": 1525713593000, \"utc_offset\": -25200000, \"waitlist_count\": 6, \"yes_rsvp_count\": 2, \"venue\": {\"id\": 24913284, \"name\": \"Lovejoy's Tea Room\", \"lat\": 37.48501205444336, \"lon\": -122.2259750366211, \"repinned\": false, \"address_1\": \"901 Main Street\", \"city\": \"Redwood City\", \"country\": \"us\", \"localized_country_name\": \"USA\", \"zip\": \"\", \"state\": \"CA\"}, \"group\": {\"created\": 1470006097000, \"name\": \"Redwood City Social Meetup\", \"id\": 20259104, \"join_mode\": \"open\", \"lat\": 37.4900016784668, \"lon\": -122.19999694824219, \"urlname\": \"Redwood-City-Social-Meetup\", \"who\": \"RWC Social Friends\", \"localized_location\": \"Redwood City, CA\", \"region\": \"en_US\"}, \"link\": \"https://www.meetup.com/Redwood-City-Social-Meetup/events/250021342/\", \"description\": \"<p>Ladies, care for an afternoon tea?

every Tuesday and Sunday at PongPlanet Club. League director will have our leagues processed for\\u00a0<a href=\\\"http://208.106.217.153/league/singles/ratings_league.html\\\">USATT League Ratings</a>. This league is for all-level players. League director will give you an estimate rating if you don't have one.</p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>League Format</b></p> <p>The league director starts off each league with a printout of potential league players, in the order of player rating. The format is to put the top five players in the first group, the next five are put in the second group, and so on down the list. If the number of players in the league is not divisible by five, then the number of players in some groups would be adjusted.\\u00a0</p> <p>Players play all other members in their group. The goal is to win the group, and to improve one\\u2019s league rating. Recommended format is best of 3 to 11 - depending on number of players and time available.</p> <p><b>League Ratings</b></p> <p>At the start of the league, players will start out with either\\u00a0<a href=\\\"http://www.usatt.org/ratings/ratingsprocess.html\\\">USATT ratings</a>\\u00a0or estimated ratings.

It's the summer before he starts high school, and Moose is going to play a lot of baseball and win a spot on the high school team. But he still needs to watch his special older sister, Natalie--and then the warden asks Moose to look after his two-faced, danger-loving daughter, Piper.</p> <p>In the cell house there are rumors that the cons will strike, and that Moose's father might step up to a new job. Moose is worried: What will this mean for their family, especially for Natalie, who's had some scary run-ins with prisoners? Then the unthinkable happens: Natalie winds up someplace she should never, ever go. And Moose has to rescue her.</p> <p>Don't miss the rest of the Tales from Alcatraz series!<br/>Al Capone Does My Shirts<br/>Al Capone Shines My Shoes<br/>Al Capone Does My Homework</p> <p>ABOUT THIS AUTHOR...</p> <p>Gennifer Choldenko is the New York Times bestselling and Newbery Honor-winning author of many popular children's books, including Notes from a Liar and Her Dog, If a Tree Falls at Lunch Period, Al Capone Does My Shirts, Al Capone Shines My Shoes, Al Capone Does My Homework, and No Passengers Beyond This Point, and from Wendy Lamb Books, Chasing Secrets.

The art of dealing with rejection is one of the most important traits that separates those that are successful and those that are not. Rejection can either destroy your confidence or build your confidence depending on how you deal with it and learn from it.</p> <p>In this meetup I will share some of my stories on rejections and the tactics that I used to cope and deal with it. Rejections are not easy in the beginning and neither was learning something new from the very first time. But given time, rejections can ultimately make a better you and it\\u2019s up to you to see that.</p> <p>About the Speaker:<br/>My name is Aaron Lam and I am currently a software engineer working at Yahoo. I'm hoping to one day own a business of my own, and in order to do that, I need to surround myself in the right environment and with the same like-minded people. In 2017, I have received 3 job offers within the span of 12 months. However, what you don't realize, is the amount of rejections I received from various companies.

Just bring your rackets and any tennis balls you may have, preferably new ones. We'll rally or play a game or something. SC Tennis Center has 8 courts there but 4 courts available if Park &amp; Rec or USTA has scheduled classes/events.</p> <p>Before you RSVP, please read: (description updated Nov 2017)</p> <p>The tennis center has a reservation and walk-in process. I will check in at the office for the courts under \\\"Shirley\\\". If you get there before me, check with the office the court numbers under my name. For those with smartphone app, please see the comment section for the court number(s) to find us. Now that Daylight Saving ended, I will collect money for the court reservation. (Most of the times, I can get the courts free of charge but be prepare to pay for the access of courts if they are full). Bring small bills. If we have to use the paid reservation option, I will split the reservation fee evenly among those who show up for tennis. Reservation is $9/hour for residents (e.g. worse case scenario: reserving 2 courts for 2 hours = $36. $36.00/8 attendees = $4.50). I use the Yes (RSVP) as headcount when I check in with the tennis center office when getting court(s). I can get max 2 courts from the tennis office (sorry, I have tried to get a 3rd court but it can't be under my name.).</p> <p>If you are coming to watch the rally/cheer at our games or to use the backboard/wall for practice, just mention in comments section. No need to rsvp for backboard nor watching. I use the Yes for court reservation.</p> <p>If you cannot make it to tennis, please UPDATE your RSVP status AS SOON AS POSSIBLE (before 1 pm). We will get charge and get kick off for empty courts if there are no-shows or if we break the reservation rules per the SC Center manager!</p> <p>Number #1 reason why you have to be diligent about your changing your RSVP: This will gives the people on the waiting list time to get to the courts. Meetup.com's servers are painfully slow in notifying organizer and the person bumped from wait list to Going/RSVP list so hence the 1 pm deadline. Also, these courts fill up quickly.</p> <p>If you have 2 no-shows to SBIO events, I will reserve the right to place you on the wait-list. We want to make the RSVP fair to those making the effort in attending the meetups.</p> <p>Wait List people: I recommend checking the Meetup app or website to see if you have been bumped to the RSVP before start time.

Supposedly, there is an easy course &amp; a hard course. I had tried putting on both courses and would vouch that both courses have their challenges. I can say the volcano-style and water-obstacles would be the ones that will try your patience on both courses.

In the second turning, we encounter the revolutionary teaching on emptiness that rocked the Buddhist world. The third turning resolves the apparent contradiction between the first and the second turnings, and teaches us about the awakened buddha nature that is beyond all suffering and liberation.

To take advantage of this rule, we recommend coming the the Writer's Discussion Group first and then attending your first Critique session.</p> <p><b>2. Context/Purpose - </b>If your writing sample is a continuation of previous writing, or it needs some sort of premise for critics to understand, please write a short summary at the top of your piece, so that people have a heads up. If you are looking for critique regarding a specific aspect alone, mention this here.</p> <p><b>3. TRIGGER WARNINGS - </b>If you write about certain topics: Graphic Violence, Rape/Non-Con, Incest, Child Abuse, Sexual Assault, Body Horror etc. You <b>MUST</b> warn the group with a TRIGGER WARNING at the top of your piece. Our group is open to all writers and content, but we also give our writers the right to avoid reading topics that may cause PTSD flashbacks. You can warn for Sex if you want to, but it isn't held in the same category as the above topics<br/><b>Failure to abide by this rule will result in a BAN</b></p> <p><b>4. Supportive Critiquing and Discussion - </b>Provide and respond to critiques in a tone that is supportive and communicates good faith. We encourage disagreements and clarifications that lead to friendly discussion and learning. But this is possible only in an environment where every individual feels welcome. Our group caters to people of diverse skill-levels, from beginners to experts. Hence, refrain from any form of intimidation, competitive bullying or personal insults. <b>We follow a three-strike policy regarding this.</b></p> <p><b>Limit writing samples to a max of:</b></p> <p>2500 words if you post it on Google Docs prior.</p> <p>250 words if you only bring a paper copy or upload at the meeting.</p> <p><b>Upload &amp; Comment Instructions :-</b></p> <p>Once the folder is shared, go into \\\"Year\\\" and then \\\"Month-Day\\\" folder.

Some folks were not able to make it as it was in the city. Jason has kindly agreed to do the talk again in Santa Clara. Thanks Jason!</p> <p>Abstract of the talk:<br/>Software testing is fundamentally an exercise in applying sample inputs to a system, and measuring the outputs to determine the correctness of the application\\u2019s behavior. This testing input and output function is very similar to the basic operations of training and executing modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) systems. The similarity implies that the field of Software Testing is ripe to benefit from recent advances in AI and ML. Software Testing and approaches to measure Software Quality have been relatively stagnant over the past decade or so, with only slight technical improvements in test frameworks and methodologies; meanwhile, product development, DevOps, and deployment have benefited greatly from increasing availability of compute, network, and storage. Software testing has remained an often linear activity with respect to test coverage- adding tests one at a time or in small batches while products add complexity at a much higher rate, meaning almost no product is tested efficiently. The complexity of products has been growing exponentially, where testing has remained more or less a linear activity with respect to test coverage.</p> <p>Applying the advancements in AI and ML will help testing \\u2018catch up\\u2019 with development advances, increase the efficiency, speed and efficacy of software testing, and free testers from many mundane testing tasks.

After representing buyers and sellers for 12 years, Brian bought his first apartment building in 1997 with the intentions to convert it into condominiums.</p> <p>After the success of that first apartment conversion, over the next ten years [masked]), Brian bought 4,000+ apartments and converted all of them to condos.</p> <p>When the recession hit in 2007, Brian shifted to helping banks auction their foreclosed inventory (REOs). By 2010, Brian bought the domain \\\"RealEstateAuctions.com\\\" (REA) and started to expand the company nationally. He moved the corporate office to Palo Alto in 2012 and has continued in the CEO chair helping the company expand to Arizona, Nevada and Montana.</p> <p>In 2017, Brian opened an acquisition division to purchase $500M in wholesale property over the next few years to rehab and the auction through RealEstateAuctions.com.</p> <p>To date, Brian has purchased a total of more than $350M in real estate and disposed in excess of $1 Billion.

This talk aims to address common pitfalls in enterprise software engineering which can be avoided through the application of functional programming principles, as well as to introduce the clarity and maintainability inherent to functional code. In this talk, we will cover computational effects including failure handling, IO and partiality using various functors and monads. We will also explore the \\\"softer\\\" side of teaching and advocating for FP at work, including strategies for coaching teammates off of imperative and side-effect ridden coding practices.</p> <p>The material in the talk will focus on Scala specifically, but the principles should apply to any programming language supporting types. While enterprise software is implied in the title, the learnings and examples in the talk can be implemented in any commercial software development environment. The content presented is intended to have multiple levels of approachability. Beginners will be exposed to FP concepts from a relatable and novel angle, while advanced programmers will learn new ways to approach and teach these concepts. Engineering managers can gain an understanding of how functional code scales and remains maintainable.</p> <p>Speaker Bio</p> <p>Narek Asadorian is a Senior Software Engineer with Salesforce, where he works on streaming data pipelines and data enrichment microservices in support of the Salesforce Inbox and Einstein Activity Capture products. He is a Scala programmer and all-around functional programming enthusiast and advocate. Narek is also the organizer of Salesforce's internal programming meetup, #lambda.

Expect most of the session to be in story format and not in typical introduction to X format. There will be plenty of time for Q &amp; A and to interact with Bas.</p> <p>LeSS is a lightweight (agile) framework for scaling Scrum to more than one team. LeSS consists of the LeSS Principles, the Framework, the Guides and a set of experiments. The LeSS framework is divided into two frameworks: basic LeSS for 2-8 teams and LeSS Huge for 8+ teams. All of these are also available on the less.works website.</p> <p>About Bas Vodde:</p> <p>Bas Vodde is a coach, programmer, trainer, and author related to modern agile and lean product development. He is the creator of the LeSS (Large-Scale Scrum) framework for scaling agile development. He coaches organizations on three levels: organizational, team, individual/technical practices. He has trained thousands of people in software development, Scrum, and modern agile practices for over a decade.</p> <p>He is the author of Large-Scale Scrum: More with LeSS, Scaling Agile and Lean Development: Thinking and Organizational Tools for Large-Scale Scrum and of Practices for Large-Scale Agile and Lean Development, all together with Craig Larman.</p> <p>Bas currently lives in Singapore where he ended up after living in Holland (born), China and Finland. He worked in start-ups and in very traditional environments. This last uncomfortable experience convinced him that agile and lean development is a more human way of developing software products -- no matter how large your development is.</p> <p>He had the opportunity to introduce Agile Development (particularly Scrum) in Nokia Networks (formally NSN) but had to move to Helsinki. There he watched dozens of product groups adopt scrum and other agile practices. The extreme cold in Finland forced him to migrate south and back to China where he focused on one large product group and its Scrum adoption.</p> <p>Bas is interested in Scrum with a special focus on large companies and large product development. But he also enjoyed working on technical practices, especially test-driven development (particularly in embedded environments) and continuous integration. He keeps working as a developer because he strongly believes you need a well-factored code base if you want to be fast and flexible. His hobbies are studies in lean production and quality management and, of course, programming.</p> <p>Bas is also one of the authors of the CppUTest unit test framework for C/C++ and of Osaka a Mac UI automation framework written in Ruby.</p> \", \"how_to_find_us\": \"We meet in the Cafeteria and sometimes the door is locked.

To get the most out of this time, you should already be able to understand and speak basic English. This is not an English class... grammar and vocabulary will not be taught. We will only focus on making English words and conversation sound better and more comfortable. Small groups of students working with native English speakers to practice should help us all to find and work through pronunciation problems faster.</p> <p>People helping at this meetup are not an English teacher, and some are not native English speakers, but we have a good ear listening for common pronunciation mistakes and have experience helping to fix them. Also, most of people helping with English pronunciation have some experience interacting with Mandarin speakers. So you are welcome to bring any list of words or text or book in English you are struggling with, or just come and start to chat, and we'll take it from there!</p> <p>Two remarks:</p> <p>(1) To newcomers: As part of the English-Mandarin language exchange meetup group, originally this event was created by Richard to help Mandarin speakers. However, we warmly welcome anybody who wants to improve his/her English pronunciation, as well as all native English speakers who want to help. Also, please note that most people who come regularly don't always RSVP even if they show up (see next remark). So please don't be scared to join if you see that only 2 or 3 people have signed up. Typically, 10-20 people come every week.</p> <p>(2) To regulars: If you are planning to join the meetup, please try to RSVP if you can. Not only this will help getting an idea of how many learners and helpers are planning to come, but also I realized that a lot of people who sign up for the first time change their mind a few hours before the event when they see that only 2-3 people have signed up.</p> <p>Hope to see you soon!</p> <p>Richard &amp; Michel</p> \", \"how_to_find_us\": \"The address on the door is 1189 E Arques Ave, but google maps doesn't find it that way.

The next step is where we set ourselves apart from the rest of the fixers and flippers. Once the project is done we give back to two organizations, the Wounded Warrior Project and the Santa Clara County Humane Society.

Singers are encouraged to pick and sing a least ONE song in theme, namely a song from popular musicals like Grease, Phantom, Les Miserable, Rent, Dreamgirls, Chicago, All that Jazz, Wicked, The Sound of Music, and so on.</p> <p>You can find some great lists of Broadway tunes online. For example, the American Film Institute has a list of the top 25 movie musicals here: <a href=\\\"http://www.afi.com/100years/musicals.aspx\\\" class=\\\"linkified\\\">http://www.afi.com/100years/musicals.aspx</a></p> <p>And here's a great list someone compiled of the top 100 showtunes: <a href=\\\"http://www.mylistpad.com/music-lists/35-soundtracks-and-theater/73-top-100-showtunes\\\" class=\\\"linkified\\\">http://www.mylistpad.com/music-lists/35-soundtracks-and-theater/73-top-100-showtunes</a> Finally, here is a list of 100 film/stage musicals for further reference: <a href=\\\"http://www.digitaldreamdoor.com/pages/movie-pages/movie_musicals.php\\\" class=\\\"linkified\\\">http://www.digitaldreamdoor.com/pages/movie-pages/movie_musicals.php</a></p> <p><a href=\\\"http://www.ejazzlines.com/BEST-BROADWAY-SONGS-EVER-p61399.html\\\" class=\\\"linkified\\\">http://www.ejazzlines.com/BEST-BROADWAY-SONGS-EVER-p61399.html</a></p> <p><a href=\\\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/louispeitzman/the-25-best-broadway-songs-about-the-theater\\\" class=\\\"linkified\\\">http://www.buzzfeed.com/louispeitzman/the-25-best-broadway-songs-about-the-theater</a></p> <p><a href=\\\"http://www.discogs.com/Various-All-Time-Broadway-Hit-Parade-The-120-Greatest-Songs/release/2768093\\\" class=\\\"linkified\\\">http://www.discogs.com/Various-All-Time-Broadway-Hit-Parade-The-120-Greatest-Songs/release/2768093</a></p> <p>In a pinch, you can pick a song from an ensemble production that showcases a particular artist/song writer's body of work, such as the musical Tommy (The Who); Mamma Mia (ABBA), Jersey Boys (The Four Seasons) and My Life (Billy Joel). We'll also take any song with the word BROADWAY in the lyrics, song title or band name. NOW HOW EASY IS THAT???</p> <p>The Gold Rush Eatery is located in the Sunken Gardens Golf Course, just one mile from 280. The nearest intersection is Wolfe &amp; El Camino. The entrance comes up quickly on Wolfe Avenue, so be on the lookout! It's easy to miss. You can enter the golf course from Sunken Gardens Terrace and follow it to the building where the Gold Rush Eatery is located. This place had a great BBQ menu and several beer and wine selections and other bar options. And of course, our Member KJ Doug Ward from Avents Empty Band does the show here, so we know we're in for a great time.</p> <p>Karaoke begins at 7:00 p.m. but we'll be meeting at 6:30 p.m. to save seats and get our songs ready. Be sure to get there close to the start time to be early in the rotation and have more changes to sing. We recommend bringing a list of songs you want to sing in order to make the most of your karaoke experience. You can save even more time by checking out Avent's Empty Band website for your song choices: www.karaokeman.com Come early to get in the most singing.</p> <p>Hope to see you there.</p> \", \"visibility\": \"public\"}, {\"link\": \"https://www.meetup.com/San-Jose-Mid-Week-Hikers-Group/events/250529497/\", \"visibility\": \"public_limited\", \"group\": {\"created\": 1319751851000, \"name\": \"San Jose Mid-Week Hikers Group\", \"id\": 2718822, \"join_mode\": \"open\", \"lat\": 37.290000915527344, \"lon\": -121.9000015258789, \"urlname\": \"San-Jose-Mid-Week-Hikers-Group\", \"who\": \"Hikers\", \"localized_location\": \"San Jose, CA\", \"region\": \"en_US\"}, \"waitlist_count\": 0, \"yes_rsvp_count\": 13, \"duration\": 16200000, \"time\": 1525968000000, \"utc_offset\": -25200000, \"name\": \"Saratoga Gap to Table Mountain and Long Ridge, 10.3 miles, 1800 feet\", \"id\": \"250529497\"}, {\"created\": 1524365825000, \"duration\": 9000000, \"id\": \"250024771\", \"name\": \"Create your Destiny -

Frank Heile Ph.D. hopes to persuade you that he has devised<br/>such a model and that you will agree that the answer is \\u201cyes!\\u201d</p> <p>The model begins with decomposing the human brain into three agents: The Thinker, Doer, and Experiencer. Frank describes the properties of the agents and evidence that supports this<br/>decomposition. He argues that the three-agent model explains the origin of spirituality. His explanation centers around the dominance of the Thinker in modern humans \\u2013 the Thinker<br/>causes suffering and spirituality alleviates this suffering. This model describes how and why spiritual practices work and explains the resulting changes in human consciousness.</p> <p>Next, Frank combines the three-agent model with Attention Schema Theory (AST). AST is a<br/>model of conscious awareness proposed by Princeton neuroscientist, Michael Graziano. The<br/>application of AST to each of the three individual agents result in three substantially different<br/>kinds of conscious awareness. Since a human being is composed of a blend of these three<br/>distinct agents, the resulting human consciousness is some combination of these three<br/>different kinds of conscious awareness. When the proportions of these three kinds of<br/>awareness vary, the human will experience multiple different types of consciousness. For<br/>example, this model can explain the differences between an animal\\u2019s consciousness, normal<br/>modern human consciousness, the consciousness experienced in a \\u201cflow\\u201d state, and the<br/>consciousness reported in states of spiritual enlightenment.</p> <p>Frank Heile, Ph.D. is the author of a forthcoming book with a tentative title of \\u201cSpirituality Explained.\\u201d Frank has undergraduate and graduate degrees in Physics from MIT and Stanford. He has had an interest in consciousness and spirituality for many years and has been working on this model of consciousness for over ten years.

About a third of the ride is wide dirt trails, another third is fire roads and the remaining third is dirt single track. There are really no rocks or difficult technical items at Fremont Older other than some singletrack downhill with some ruts to maneuver around.</p> <p>Here is a YouTube video from a recent ride in January 2015: <a href=\\\"https://youtu.be/LaljijEb76Y\\\" class=\\\"embedded\\\">https://youtu.be/LaljijEb76Y</a></p> <p>The climb to Maisie\\u2019s Peak is a good skill builder because the climb is broken into segments. This makes it very easy for the group to gather up if there are slower riders who are beginning to build their mountain biking skills. The peak is a great destination because you are rewarded with a really nice view!</p> <p>ABOUT THE RIDE\\u2026</p> <p>Our ride will start near 22664 Prospect Road, Cupertino, CA. This is the very end of Prospect Road behind the Saratoga Golf Course. The ride starts with a climb from the parking lot to the center of the preserve. From there we will go up to Maisie\\u2019s Peak for a great view of Silicon Valley, then we\\u2019ll go downhill around Seven Springs Loop followed by a small climb back up and then back down again to the parking lot.</p> <p>NOW THE NITTY GRITTY\\u2026</p> <p>West Coast Mountain Biking is a group riding community. We don't really encourage individuals to come out to our rides that want to do their own ride five minutes after starting with us. We start together and stick together. No one gets dropped period. Of course if you have to bail for any reason, that's fine just make sure either myself or whoever is sweeping the ride knows and makes sure you know your way back to the cars. WCMB is okay with guests on our rides, even kids, just remember that they are your guests and as such they agree to the same terms of meetup that you did when you signed up <a href=\\\"http://www.meetup.com/terms/\\\" class=\\\"linkified\\\">http://www.meetup.com/terms/</a>.

The potential is huge. People have been dreaming about owning a self-driving car for decades, and recent sales have shown that consumers are willing to spend big bucks for this dream.</p> <p>The final push to widespread availability of fully autonomous vehicles has begun. Testing has moved onto public roads, and in the next few years, several vendors plan to release autonomous vehicles in limited-use \\u201cLevel 4\\u201d situations (taxis, transit companies, fleet operations, freeway-only driving). As the technology advances from \\u201cassisted driving\\u201d to true self-driving, consumer-ready vehicles for general road travel (Level 5) will be tailgating right behind.</p> <p>In this panel, industry-leading startups, entrepreneurs, and investors will explore the technologies and challenges related to realizing the dream of a fully autonomous self-driving vehicle \\u2014 i.e. a vehicle that a human does not need to monitor and that can completely take over all driving responsibilities.</p> <p>\\u2022 Will small startups or large corporations have the inside track?<br/>\\u2022 How will we know when self-driving cars are safe enough?<br/>\\u2022 How will self-driving cars change our lifestyle?</p> <p>Take a ride with us on May 24 to find out.</p> <p>___________________________</p> <p>Panelists<br/>\\u2022 Sterling Anderson, Co-Founder and Chief Product Officer, Aurora<br/>\\u2022 Ivan Mihov, Director of Program Management, Zoox<br/>\\u2022 Alexei Andreev, Managing Director, Autotech Ventures</p> <p>*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*</p> <p>Important: Tickets are required for this event.<br/>Please purchase your ticket at <a href=\\\"https://vlab.org/events/fully-autonomous-vehicles/\\\" class=\\\"linkified\\\">https://vlab.org/events/fully-autonomous-vehicles/</a></p> <p>*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*</p> \", \"visibility\": \"public\"}, {\"link\": \"https://www.meetup.com/Palo-Alto-Monthly-Tea-Times-and-Art-Tours-for-50-Women/events/243419939/\", \"visibility\": \"public_limited\", \"group\": {\"created\": 1412396037000, \"name\": \"Palo Alto Monthly Tea Times and Art Tours for 50+ Women\", \"id\": 17389072, \"join_mode\": \"open\", \"lat\": 37.41999816894531, \"lon\": -122.12999725341797, \"urlname\": \"Palo-Alto-Monthly-Tea-Times-and-Art-Tours-for-50-Women\", \"who\": \"Friendly Women Who Like to Chat\", \"localized_location\": \"Palo Alto, CA\", \"region\": \"en_US\"}, \"waitlist_count\": 0, \"yes_rsvp_count\": 10, \"duration\": 7200000, \"time\": 1527368400000, \"utc_offset\": -25200000, \"name\": \"High Time for Tea Time.

Trevor was born to a white Swiss father and a black Xhosa mother at a time when such a union was punishable by five years in prison. Living proof of his parents\\u2019 indiscretion, Trevor was kept mostly indoors for the earliest years of his life, bound by the extreme and often absurd measures his mother took to hide him from a government that could, at any moment, steal him away. Finally liberated by the end of South Africa\\u2019s tyrannical white rule, Trevor and his mother set forth on a grand adventure, living openly and freely and embracing the opportunities won by a centuries-long struggle.</p> <p>Born a Crime is the story of a mischievous young boy who grows into a restless young man as he struggles to find himself in a world where he was never supposed to exist. It is also the story of that young man\\u2019s relationship with his fearless, rebellious, and fervently religious mother\\u2014his teammate, a woman determined to save her son from the cycle of poverty, violence, and abuse that would ultimately threaten her own life.</p> <p>The stories collected here are by turns hilarious, dramatic, and deeply affecting. Whether subsisting on caterpillars for dinner during hard times, being thrown from a moving car during an attempted kidnapping, or just trying to survive the lifeand- death pitfalls of dating in high school, Trevor illuminates his curious world with an incisive wit and unflinching honesty. His stories weave together to form a moving and searingly funny portrait of a boy making his way through a damaged world in a dangerous time, armed only with a keen sense of humor and a mother\\u2019s unconventional, unconditional love.</p> \", \"visibility\": \"public\"}, {\"link\": \"https://www.meetup.com/San-Jose-Mid-Week-Hikers-Group/events/250227458/\", \"visibility\": \"public_limited\", \"group\": {\"created\": 1319751851000, \"name\": \"San Jose Mid-Week Hikers Group\", \"id\": 2718822, \"join_mode\": \"open\", \"lat\": 37.290000915527344, \"lon\": -121.9000015258789, \"urlname\": \"San-Jose-Mid-Week-Hikers-Group\", \"who\": \"Hikers\", \"localized_location\": \"San Jose, CA\", \"region\": \"en_US\"}, \"waitlist_count\": 2, \"yes_rsvp_count\": 20, \"duration\": 16200000, \"time\": 1525881600000, \"utc_offset\": -25200000, \"name\": \"Sanborn County Park loop w/ Nicholas trail, ~9 miles 1800 feet\", \"id\": \"250227458\"}, {\"created\": 1522257249000, \"duration\": 246600000, \"id\": \"249195551\", \"name\": \"Internet of Things World\", \"status\": \"upcoming\", \"time\": 1526358600000, \"local_date\": \"2018-05-14\", \"local_time\": \"21:30\", \"updated\": 1522271838000, \"utc_offset\": -25200000, \"waitlist_count\": 0, \"yes_rsvp_count\": 26, \"venue\": {\"id\": 184054, \"name\": \"Santa Clara Convention Center\", \"lat\": 37.40275573730469, \"lon\": -121.9789047241211, \"repinned\": false, \"address_1\": \"5001 Great America Pkwy\", \"city\": \"Santa Clara\", \"country\": \"us\", \"localized_country_name\": \"USA\", \"phone\": \"800.272.6822 \", \"zip\": \"95054\", \"state\": \"CA\"}, \"group\": {\"created\": 1423976306000, \"name\": \"Internet of Things Developers - IoTD\", \"id\": 18435538, \"join_mode\": \"open\", \"lat\": 37.38999938964844, \"lon\": -121.9000015258789, \"urlname\": \"IoTD-Group\", \"who\": \"Members\", \"localized_location\": \"San Jose, CA\", \"region\": \"en_US\"}, \"link\": \"https://www.meetup.com/IoTD-Group/events/249195551/\", \"description\": \"<p>***PLEASE register the conference from the event page.

The brothers family blend of folk encapsulates the grit and humor of Midwest life with the swagger and serenity of the west coast. Their style evokes finger picking folk singers of the 60\\u2019s and 70\\u2019s with a contemporary and boundless edge. Cultivated from years of performing in bands ranging from heavy metal to reggae and rock, to punk, country, and funk, their musical dichotomy is at the root of their diverse yet seamless folk-brand.<br/>With their comedic brotherly banter, impeccable harmonic expression, and widely varying influences, a Brothers Reed performance will have you reflecting on lost lives and lovers, laughing hysterically and leaving completely entertained.<br/>Touring as a guitar-duo, the group incorporates harmonica, percussion and keys into their live performances, soothing your soul with songs that are familiar yet original. Whether they are finger picking their way through a lamentable ballad or bringing you around full-speed with a barn-burning bluegrass number, The Brothers Reed are masters of their craft.</p> \", \"visibility\": \"public\"}, {\"created\": 1506578854000, \"id\": \"qqkcvnyxhbnb\", \"name\": \"Free Meditation Classes\", \"status\": \"upcoming\", \"time\": 1526004900000, \"local_date\": \"2018-05-10\", \"local_time\": \"19:15\", \"updated\": 1506578854000, \"utc_offset\": -25200000, \"waitlist_count\": 0, \"yes_rsvp_count\": 1, \"group\": {\"created\": 1502333207000, \"name\": \"Santa Clara HackerDojo Meditation Meetup\", \"id\": 25430314, \"join_mode\": \"open\", \"lat\": 37.349998474121094, \"lon\": -121.95999908447266, \"urlname\": \"Santa-Clara-HackerDojo-Meditation-Meetup\", \"who\": \"Members\", \"localized_location\": \"Santa Clara, CA\", \"region\": \"en_US\"}, \"link\": \"https://www.meetup.com/Santa-Clara-HackerDojo-Meditation-Meetup/events/250478314/\", \"description\": \"<p>Free Meditation</p> <p>Five minutes of introduction, 15-20 minutes of meditation and movement, 5-10 minutes break, 15-20 minutes of meditation and movement, and conclude with five minutes of questions and answers.</p> \", \"how_to_find_us\": \"Hacker Dojo \\u2022 3350 Thomas Rd, Suite 150, Santa Clara CA 95054\", \"visibility\": \"public\"}, {\"created\": 1520581793000, \"duration\": 3600000, \"id\": \"dlzklpyxhblb\", \"name\": \"Inferno \", \"rsvp_limit\": 6, \"status\": \"upcoming\", \"time\": 1525829400000, \"local_date\": \"2018-05-08\", \"local_time\": \"18:30\", \"updated\": 1520581793000, \"utc_offset\": -25200000, \"waitlist_count\": 0, \"yes_rsvp_count\": 1, \"venue\": {\"id\": 24118409, \"name\": \"Eagle Park\", \"lat\": 37.38893127441406, \"lon\": -122.08519744873047, \"repinned\": false, \"address_1\": \"650 Franklin St\", \"city\": \"Mountain View\", \"country\": \"us\", \"localized_country_name\": \"USA\", \"zip\": \"\", \"state\": \"CA\"}, \"group\": {\"created\": 1443422761000, \"name\": \"Get Fit In The Park (Yoga/Semi-Private Training)\", \"id\": 18974646, \"join_mode\": \"open\", \"lat\": 37.380001068115234, \"lon\": -122.08000183105469, \"urlname\": \"fun2befit\", \"who\": \"Fun2Be Fitters\", \"localized_location\": \"Mountain View, CA\", \"region\": \"en_US\"}, \"link\": \"https://www.meetup.com/fun2befit/events/250402052/\", \"description\": \"<p>\\u2022 What we'll do<br/>Light your fire....Join the Inferno!</p> <p>Looking for something to torch calories and give you that extra push?

Most of this previous work is incomplete because they require humans to make the final decisions about any database changes and are reactionary measures that fix problems after they occur. What is needed for a \\\"self-driving\\\" DBMS are components that are designed for autonomous operation. This will enable new optimizations that are not possible today because the complexity of managing these systems has surpassed the abilities of humans.</p> <p>In this talk, I present the core principles of an autonomous DBMS based on reinforcement learning. These are necessary to support ample data collection, fast state changes, and accurate reward observations. I will discuss techniques on how to build a new autonomous DBMS or the steps needed to retrofit an existing one to enable automated management. Our work is based on our experiences at CMU from developing an automatic tuning service (OtterTune) and our self-driving DBMS (Peloton).</p> <p>+ 10-Min Presentation: TiDB 2.0 update by Ed Huang, co-founder and CTO of PingCAP. Here's the release blog post (<a href=\\\"https://pingcap.com/blog/tidb-2-0-announcement/\\\" class=\\\"linkified\\\">https://pingcap.com/blog/tidb-2-0-announcement/</a>)</p> <p>2nd Talk:</p> <p>By: Siddon Tang (@siddontang), Chief Engineer of PingCAP and team lead of TiKV, a distributed key-value store. He also contributes actively in other open-source projects, like LedisDB, go-mysql, and go-mysql-elasticsearch.</p> <p>Title: Building a Transactional Key-Value Store in Rust That Scales to 100+ Nodes</p> <p>*Abstract*<br/>As a distributed key-value storage engine, TiKV supports strong data consistency, auto-horizontal scalability, and ACID transaction. This talk will focus on how Siddon's team built TiKV using Rust, and how it can scale to 100+ nodes in production environments.</p> <p>Run of show:</p> <p>+ 6:00PM - Doors open, Dinner begins, Mingling occurs<br/>7:00PM - 1st talk by Professor Andy Pavlo<br/>+ 7:40PM - TiDB 2.0 update by Ed Huang<br/>7:50PM - 2nd talk by Siddon Tang<br/>8:30PM - Raffling begins (Prize: Google Home Mini; You must be physically present to get the prize)<br/>8:40PM - Event ends</p> <p>Ping me via meetup if you have any questions.

It was interesting to see that even Dr. Zosimov (highly educated man) was convinced by the official version of the police department, where a painter is the main suspect, the version that does not make very logical sense. Is it possible that some of the high profile accusations we are bombarded on the tv, are concocted via dubious evidence, or maybe we should just accept all accusations at face value because tv said so, and little people in tv are unquestionable authority figures\\u2026.</p> <p>Luzhin of course showed up with a very imposing veneer, that faded like a smoke after he realized that he is unwelcomed, and moreover, that in Raskol\\u2019nikov eyes\\u2019 Luzhin, despite his highly esteemed position, as a human character is sorta nobody\\u2026. Vanity still overcame Luzhin and he laid out his theory that pursuing material self interest makes the world a better place and make other people productive. Luzhin bragged on and discussed how there is upsurge in economic crimes and demoralization of civic society: forgery, mailman robbery; everyone wants to get rich fast by all means possible. Then Raskol\\u2019nikov chimes in, \\u201cWhy, carry out logically the theory you were advocating just now, and it follows that people may be killed ...\\u201d Is there a possibility that Raskol\\u2019nikov is exposed to the same progressive ideas as Luzhin, and that Raskol\\u2019nikov has already put that theory to practice? Had Raskol\\u2019nikov killed those people out of self-interest, to test the strength of his character, or did he kill the people just to save the world from poverty, and make the world full of rainbows and unicorns, or maybe he just primitively wanted to get rich quickly, just like those robbers and forgers?</p> <p>Some members were convinced that more than anything the ideology of rescuing the world by murdering somebody is just a cover up for Raskol\\u2019nikov to get him and his family out of poverty. Yet, if it\\u2019s all about money why he so freely gives so much money to Marmeladov\\u2019s family when Marmeladov is killed?

Unfortunately, most of these mentions merely pay lip service to the need for higher efficiency without going deeper into exactly what this means and methodologies for how to actually achieve high efficiency and power savings. It is also important to understand why a bigger battery is not the answer for most solutions and that clarifying this point along with internalizing intelligent power management is essential to making or breaking the astounding volume predictions of the IoT/Wearable/Sensor Network markets.</p> <p>This talk will provide a short overview of the key design needs (driven by market demands/challenges), then focus on defining energy harvesting, in its many forms, and understanding the various constituents of the existing, production, energy harvesting ecosystem from energy capture (i.e. \\u2013 transducers) to control/conversion/regulation/battery management (i.e. \\u2013 power management ICs or PMICs) to storage (i.e. \\u2013 batteries, supercapacitors, etc.) and beyond. The many forms of scavenged energy will be broken down to better understand the associated voltage/power levels along with matching to practical applications. In an incremental way, it will be demonstrated how energy harvesting technologies can serve many useful purposes to supplement battery life in applications that cannot be fully sustained by scavenged energy, which provides a roadmap from partial to the eventual full mitigation of batteries.</p> <p>About the speaker:</p> <p>Brian Zahnstecher is a Sr. Member of the IEEE, Chair of the IEEE SFBAC Power Electronics Society (PELS) awarded 2017 Best Chapter awards at the local/national/worldwide levels concurrently (an unprecedented achievement), sits on the Power Sources Manufacturers Association (PSMA) Board of Directors, and is the Principal of PowerRox, where he focuses on power design, integration, system applications, OEM market penetration, market research/analysis, and private seminars for power electronics.</p> <p>He leads Power for the IEEE 5G Roadmap Applications &amp; Services Working Group, authored the Group\\u2019s position paper, and has lectured on this topic at major industry conferences.

After we will follow with sharing in small groups. Topics will range from difficulty conceiving, miscarriage, medical and therapeutic interventions, grief and loss, adoption and surrogacy, and relationship support. We will follow the principles of maintaining privacy and offer no advice, but prayer and support. Q: Will childcare be offered?<br/>A: As a new group, we are unable to offer childcare at present, but hope to offer this in the future.</p> <p>Q: What is the commitment level of this lifegroup? Will I be expected to attend regularly?<br/>A: We understand that this issue in particular can range from a short-term need to one that is more ongoing. Please feel free to attend as little or as much as you'd need. While registration is not required, it is helpful for the facilitators to plan.</p> <p>Q: Are husbands/partners welcome?<br/>A: For the time being, we ask that women launch this group to develop a sense of discretion around stories that are private and sensitive. As the format matures, we will seek ways to include male partners.</p> <p>Q: I can't attend the meetings, but would like to learn more about the discussion materials.<br/>A: Our discussion materials are available on Amazon: 31 Days of Prayer During Infertility by Lisa Newton, and the author's blog, <a href=\\\"http://www.amateurnester.com\\\" class=\\\"linkified\\\">http://www.amateurnester.com</a>.

What is special about this club? This is time set aside just for creativity and yourself. Here you will find an atmosphere of positivity, fun, acceptance and support.</p> <p>The space where we meet is an art school (Lascaux Academy, El Camino, Belmont (edge of San Carlos).)\\u00a0 There are all kinds of media, paper, tools. There is clay and other types of stuff. A lot of our members are hands on creators and crafters but people work in digital, writing, whatever.</p> <p>Each person can choose each time if they want to focus on their project or mix it up and talk with other people. It\\u2019s really amazing how much we pick up from talking to each other and by just seeing what other people are doing.</p> <p>With a focus on creativity it is a totally nonjudgmental environment. The group as a whole does not talk about marketing, \\u201cthe art world,\\u201d how to get into galleries, etc., we are too busy <i>doing</i> art and having fun.</p> <p>We play music, bring food to share. We don\\u2019t seem to need rules\\u2026everyone recognizes the nature of this group, common courtesy, positivity, friendliness, helping out.</p> <p>WHERE\\u2026There is feedback that it is hard to find, probably because it is a bit hard to find (working on that.) For orientation, it almost on the border of San Carlos. No matter how you come by car you will be going Northbound (towards SF) on El Camino. Forget finding Lascaux by sign! It is located in a 10 business strip mall that has a Domino\\u2019s Pizza in the middle. Find Domino\\u2019s, also at 1501 El Camino, 94002. At Dominoes\\u2019, slow down. At the end of the strip mall there is an unmarked, unlit driveway that goes down <i>behind </i>the buildings and has 40 parking spaces. If you see street parking that is fine except where it is green 15-minute parking. Lascaux Academy is the \\u201clast\\u201d space in the strip mall.</p> <p><img src=\\\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/d/1/f/600_444472511.jpeg\\\" /></p> <p>Message from the founder...\\u00a0<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\u00a0<br/>**I believe we are helpers to each other's unfolding, and I want this to be a space where our creative work becomes manifested into the world.

It is an expression of the new face of Zen, of how Zen practice is being established in America.</p> <p>For thousands of years, before it came to the U.S. in the 1960\\u2019s, Zen was practiced by \\u201cexclusive people,\\u201d individuals who chose to live an ascetic and celibate life, away from ordinary society. They lived in monasteries, following strict rules and a strict schedule that included several hours of meditation every day. They slept and took their meals side by side in the meditation hall, and bathed together in the communal bath. They chose to live apart from the everyday world in order to pursue their spiritual practice single-mindedly, without distraction. They did not have to go to work, raise a family, pay rent, meet deadlines, absorb new technologies every few months, endure long commutes, or care for aging parents. And they did not feel the stress that accompanies fulfilling such responsibilities. Rather, they were supported in their spiritual seeking by the closeness of their isolated community.</p> <p>In today\\u2019s fast-changing world, Zen is being practiced by folks in the mainstream of American life, men and women who have to find a way to incorporate the practice into their busy lives. Unlike monks in the monastery, we live apart from each other, coming together only occasionally when our schedules permit. The traditional feeling and support of community - so essential to practice - is elusive. In the absence of living together, we have to find new ways to develop that support for each other.</p> <p>Our coming together this Saturday is perhaps the most important way. By sharing our experiences, by listening to each other, by asking the important questions, by establishing closer relationships, we can create the sense of intimacy of individuals working together for the same ends. So whether you are new to Zen practice or a long-time member of Kannon Do, I would like to encourage you to make time in your schedule to be part of what I anticipate will be a meaningful morning.</p> \", \"visibility\": \"public\"}, {\"link\": \"https://www.meetup.com/our-gang-of-the-south-bay/events/250523044/\", \"visibility\": \"public_limited\", \"group\": {\"created\": 1425931977000, \"name\": \"\\\"Our Gang\\\" of the South Bay\", \"id\": 18489144, \"join_mode\": \"approval\", \"lat\": 37.279998779296875, \"lon\": -121.95999908447266, \"urlname\": \"our-gang-of-the-south-bay\", \"who\": \"Joyful Folks\", \"localized_location\": \"Campbell, CA\", \"region\": \"en_US\"}, \"waitlist_count\": 0, \"yes_rsvp_count\": 1, \"duration\": 5400000, \"time\": 1526142600000, \"utc_offset\": -25200000, \"name\": \"Morning Walk, Followed by Coffee\", \"id\": \"dvrtmpyxhbqb\"}, {\"created\": 1456792481000, \"id\": \"xzhbrlyxhblb\", \"name\": \"Kundalini Yoga and Meditation at One Heart Yoga Menlo Park\", \"status\": \"upcoming\", \"time\": 1525831200000, \"local_date\": \"2018-05-08\", \"local_time\": \"19:00\", \"updated\": 1459740833000, \"utc_offset\": -25200000, \"waitlist_count\": 0, \"yes_rsvp_count\": 3, \"venue\": {\"id\": 24200802, \"name\": \"One Heart Yoga in Little House at Roslyn G.

She went on to help create the Board of Directors, and traveled for several years founding chapters at multiple other campuses. The sorority still exists today and has helped to grow women in leadership across the United States. She was a member of the Boston Women\\u2019s Networking Group\\u2019s board at Fidelity, and started a women\\u2019s leadership organization at her last company, GRIT (Grow, Inspire, Train) at Quantcast. As a supporter of non profit leadership, Rachel also sat on the Hillel Lay board of Sacramento/Davis, served on Boston\\u2019s Jewish Young Adult Strategy &amp; Planning Committee, and on Boston\\u2019s Young Jewish Leaders\\u2019 Counsel.</p> <p>She currently oversees HR at Reflektive and has coached leaders for the past 10 years at Fidelity, Quantcast, and now, Reflektive. She is particularly passionate about listening and making sure the right voices are heard to drive key business decisions at the leadership level.</p> <p>Rachel earned her Bachelor\\u2019s Degree from UC Davis in International Relations and Business German, and received her MBA at Brandeis International Business School.</p> \", \"visibility\": \"public\"}, {\"created\": 1517160352000, \"duration\": 7200000, \"id\": \"247251517\", \"name\": \"Soir\\u00e9e Bachata avec Orlando et Vanessa (debutant)\", \"rsvp_limit\": 60, \"status\": \"upcoming\", \"time\": 1526088600000, \"local_date\": \"2018-05-11\", \"local_time\": \"18:30\", \"updated\": 1522101343000, \"utc_offset\": -25200000, \"waitlist_count\": 0, \"yes_rsvp_count\": 12, \"venue\": {\"id\": 25672239, \"name\": \"Aloft hotel\", \"lat\": 37.31657028198242, \"lon\": -121.97721099853516, \"repinned\": false, \"address_1\": \"4241 Moorpark Ave\", \"city\": \"San Jose\", \"country\": \"us\", \"localized_country_name\": \"USA\", \"zip\": \"95129\", \"state\": \"ca\"}, \"group\": {\"created\": 1180918735000, \"name\": \"Les Gaulois\", \"id\": 517907, \"join_mode\": \"open\", \"lat\": 37.41999816894531, \"lon\": -122.12999725341797, \"urlname\": \"LesGaulois\", \"who\": \"Gaulois\", \"localized_location\": \"Palo Alto, CA\", \"region\": \"en_US\"}, \"link\": \"https://www.meetup.com/LesGaulois/events/247251517/\", \"description\": \"<p>\\u2022 What we'll do<br/>Rejoignez nous le 11 Mai au Aloft de San Jose pour une soir\\u00e9e Bachata!

There will be a half marathon event (#2) and possibly a full marathon event (#3) at a later date, so stay tuned for announcements.</p> <p>EVENT SUMMARY: On Saturdays we typically start at Thamien Park and run out to Alviso and cover several miles of the 8.6 mile loop out there. I decided we should have an unofficial race which covers just the 8.6 mile loop. Unofficial means there will be NO SUPPORT of any kind (i.e. aid or water stations). You will have to supply your own water/fuel for the event. We will need a couple of volunteers to help with the manual timing of the participants, so let me know if you are interested in doing that.</p> <p>WHAT TO BRING: Bring sunscreen, a hat, and sunglasses because there is no shade on this trail. There is water fountain and rest rooms at the start, but plan to bring enough water to run 8.6 miles.</p> <p>ROUTE DESCRIPTION: See the map link in the next section for the race route. It is approximately 8.6 miles (I have confirmed this with my Garmin GPS watch on numerous runs) and as long as it does not rain within 7 days of the event, the trail terrain will range between packed dirt/rocks to soft dirt. Definitely take the time to study the route if you have never ran this loop before. There are a couple of false left turns which lead to no where.</p> <p>ROUTE MAP: <a href=\\\"http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/2019869947\\\" class=\\\"linkified\\\">http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/2019869947</a></p> <p>EVENT START TIME: The park's gate should be open by 8 AM and there should be plenty of parking inside the gate. If no parking is available, make sure to pay attention to the no parking zones outside the park to avoid getting a ticket. Please plan to arrive between 8:00 AM and 8:15 AM and meet near the bathrooms.

I used to hold a meetup in 2003 specific to sharing and accepting critique. I believe it is one of the fastest ways to improve your work. As an artist you have to learn to accept and understand feedback to grow and become even greater!</p> <p>I apologize to our SF members &amp; understand if this is a bit far for you to travel to this one. We will have social nights nearer SF in the future, but I have used this venue in the past, so I am kicking off our first social nights here until other venues come into play &amp; appreciate your patience.</p> <p>SOCIAL NIGHT AGENDA -</p> <p>7pm - Start Time</p> <p>Bring some of your soft copy or hard copy images to share with us and ask for opinions. You can bring them on your tablet, laptop, or prints if you wish. I would recommend tablet and focusing on just 5 images at a time specifically for critiques. Preferably some of your most recent work and its good to show groupings of work if they have a same project theme. But not necessary, they can all be different themes or if you are wondering about past images you have accomplished that's fine too.<br/>You can bring any type of photography work.</p> <p>Go grab a drink to enjoy, come back and introduce us to your work, tell us about your inspirations and/or current projects.

We are an activist organization, not a party; through campus and community-based chapters DSA members use a variety of tactics, from legislative to direct action to mutual aid, to fight for reforms that empower working people.

Sunday worship at Ananda helps us get back in touch with that center once again\\u2014whether it be called the soul, the Self, or God.</p> <p>The Sunday worship service at Ananda is inspired by the meditation tradition of the East and the ancient teachings of mystical Christianity, with inspirational readings from both the Bible and the Bhagavad Gita. Service includes music, group chanting and meditation, an inspirational talk drawn from the writings of <a href=\\\"http://www.anandapaloalto.org/joy/gurus.html#Yogananda\\\">Paramhansa Yogananda</a>, and a unique blessing ceremony called the Festival of Light.</p> <p>Before service begins at 10 am, you are welcome to a period of silent meditation from 9 to 9:45 am. Those who wish can also participate in a ceremony of individual prayer for freedom or clarity about a personal challenge, called the Purification Ceremony. You may offer that prayer at the altar and receive a blessing from one of the ministers.</p> <p><img src=\\\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/f/6/9/600_459192137.jpeg\\\" /></p> <p>Nayaswami Asha (above) gives services most Sundays with her characteristic clarity, wisdom, and humor.

The views are some of the best in the Bay Area and hopefully this will provide a space for you to honor a loved one as well.</p> \", \"visibility\": \"public\", \"pro_is_email_shared\": false}, {\"created\": 1520827523000, \"duration\": 28800000, \"id\": \"248652213\", \"name\": \"Build Actions For Your Community - Create Actions for Google Assistant\", \"status\": \"upcoming\", \"time\": 1527264000000, \"local_date\": \"2018-05-25\", \"local_time\": \"09:00\", \"updated\": 1525205372000, \"utc_offset\": -25200000, \"waitlist_count\": 0, \"yes_rsvp_count\": 63, \"venue\": {\"id\": 24137208, \"name\": \"Google Building SB45\", \"lat\": 37.41797637939453, \"lon\": -122.07110595703125, \"repinned\": false, \"address_1\": \"1345 Shorebird Way, Mountain View\", \"city\": \"94043\", \"country\": \"us\", \"localized_country_name\": \"USA\", \"zip\": \"\", \"state\": \"CA\"}, \"group\": {\"created\": 1444166457000, \"name\": \"SF/Bay AI Tech Talks Group\", \"id\": 19002699, \"join_mode\": \"open\", \"lat\": 37.40999984741211, \"lon\": -122.05000305175781, \"urlname\": \"aittg-sfsv\", \"who\": \"geeks\", \"localized_location\": \"Mountain View, CA\", \"region\": \"en_US\"}, \"link\": \"https://www.meetup.com/aittg-sfsv/events/248652213/\", \"description\": \"<p>\\u2022 What we'll do<br/>\\\"Build Actions for Your Community\\\" is a 1-day event for developers of all skill level to come together to learn how to create Actions for Google Assistant.

These inventions have profound upsides, but their appeal isn\\u2019t an accident. Technology companies and marketers have teams of engineers and researchers devoted to keeping us engaged. They know how to push our buttons, and how to coax us into using their products for hours, days, and weeks on end.</p> <p>Tracing addiction through history, Alter shows that we\\u2019re only just beginning to understand the epidemic of behavioral addiction gripping society. He takes us inside the human brain at the very moment we score points on a smartphone game, or see that someone has liked a photo we\\u2019ve posted on Instagram. But more than that, Alter heads the problem off at the pass, letting us know what we can do to step away from the screen.

Training large models is time consuming, often taking days, weeks, or months, even with expensive the fie GPU-based infrastructure. This limits the rate of research, human and infrastructure efficiency, time to market, and imposes constraints on the methods and data developers use for their work. It is simply too costly to explore models that take this long to train.</p> <p>In this talk, Dr. Hock will present a high level review of the computational workload presented by neural networks, the challenges it presents to computing in general, and the particular challenges it presents to processors designed and optimized for other work. He will discuss the advantages of dedicated hardware for deep learning and suggest a collection of approaches to radically reduce inference latency and training time.</p> <p>Speaker:</p> <p>Dr. Andy Hock is Director of Product for Cerebras Systems, which is building a new hardware device that will accelerate deep learning and artificial intelligence, and fundamentally shift the compute landscape. At Cerebras, Andy leads product strategy across hardware, software, and machine learning research. Previously, he led Product Management for data and analytics at Google-Terra Bella, using machine learning to fuel object detection in satellite imagery. Andy has a Ph.D. in Geophysics and Space Physics from UCLA, B.A. in Astronomy-Physics from Colgate University.</p> <p>AGENDA<br/>6:00 - 6:30 Registration and cocktails<br/>6:30 - 6:45 Introduction by The Hive<br/>6:45 - 7:30 Talk on Accelerating Compute for Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence<br/>7:30- 7:45 Q&amp;A<br/>7:45-8:00 Networking</p> <p>As a friend of The Hive, IntelAI has given our community free tickets to IntelAI Developer Conference on May 23rd-24th, 2018 at the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco: <a href=\\\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/events/ai/devcon.html\\\" class=\\\"linkified\\\">https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/events/ai/devcon.html</a></p> <p>We will be giving out the discount code at the next meetup.

Keeping to back roads and trails wherever possible, the route begins in Redwood City's marina neighborhood, crosses two city parks, climbs into the hilly forests of Huddart Park and Purisima Creek Open Space, and finishes on the beach in Half Moon Bay. We\\u2019ll visit some awesome locations and gain bragging rights for crossing completely over a major geographical feature. What could be more fun?</p> <p>The route is roughly 22 miles with 3000 ft of climbing, on a mix of urban streets, suburban neighborhoods, shady forests, and quiet country lanes. It's very similar to the 2017 route, but 1 mile longer due to some tweaks in the first half to add more trails and avoid the steepest climbs. A map of the route is here:<br/><a href=\\\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1PfCu_IL6New-dVpTh2GPLXjA3dtAaBtI\\\" class=\\\"linkified\\\">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1PfCu_IL6New-dVpTh2GPLXjA3dtAaBtI</a></p> <p>This is a group run at an easy pace. We\\u2019ll stay together, and average about 10 minute miles with plenty of rest breaks. You don\\u2019t need to be fast, but you should have the stamina to handle the distance and the climbs. If you\\u2019ve done other weekend long runs with the Peninsula Trail Runners, you can do this.</p> <p>Water and bathrooms are available at the start, as well as many other places in the early miles. The last water stop is in Huddart Park at mile 9, so you'll need to carry enough water for the final 13 miles.</p> <p>After dipping our toes into the ocean at the beach, we\\u2019ll have lunch together in Half Moon Bay. Don\\u2019t forget to bring some money and maybe a spare shirt and a towel.</p> <p>YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR OWN POST-RUN TRANSPORTATION. Interested runners will arrange a group car shuttle, carpool, Uber, or other ride. Use the comments section here, or email or Facebook to coordinate rides ahead of time. Please don't just show up at the start with zero transportation plans.</p> <p>FAQ:</p> <p>**Sounds fun, but I don't know anybody in the group.** Don't worry, we're friendly! Come to some of the other Peninsula Trail Runners events before this one, if you want to introduce yourself.</p> <p>**After finishing, how will we get back to the start?** That's up to you. Last year a few people met in Half Moon Bay ahead of time, and left all but one of their cars at the finish, then carpooled to the start. We'll probably have similar car shuttles again this year, so leave a note in the comments below if you're interested in joining one of those. SamTrans busses also serve Half Moon Bay, or you can call Uber or Lyft to give you a quick ride back over the hill.</p> <p>**I don't think I can run 22 miles, can I do part of the route?** This is the annual *Trans-Peninsula* Run, so we encourage everyone to do the whole crossing. If you're not ready for 22 miles yet, start training so you'll be ready for next year! If you really want a partial route, we recommend starting in Half Moon Bay, and run the route in reverse until you meet the main group, then turn around and run with us to the finish. If you try joining up somewhere else, you'll need to arrange your own transportation back there afterwards.</p> <p>**I'm worried I'll be too slow.** We're not speed demons. Last year we did the route in about 4 hours of actual running, 5 hours of elapsed time, including many rest breaks and a stop for popsicles. Something like a 10 or 11 minute per mile average pace, though it varied greatly with the terrain. Stamina is more important than speed for this route.</p> \", \"how_to_find_us\": \"Meet us by the bathrooms in the Bair Island Public Parking lot.

My research has focused on developing novel techniques to draw a viewer's attention to regions of interest in large datasets. These techniques are specifically designed to increase the efficient completion of tasks and to improve the user experience. In this talk, I will present my approaches to solving real-world problems in the fields of atmospheric physics, neurosurgery and mobile data visualization. Our techniques provide temporal context to atmospheric physicists for improved hurricane exploration. I will also present augmented visualization techniques for image-guided navigation during neurosurgery that have resulted in an increased accuracy and confidence among neurosurgeons as compared to the state-of-the-art. I will also present new work from our lab on foveated visualization for rapid exploration that addresses computational complexity when visualizing large datasets.</p> <p>SPEAKER BIO<br/>Alark Joshi is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of San Francisco, where he works on data visualization projects for improved neurosurgical planning and treatment. His research focuses on developing and evaluating the ability of novel visualization techniques to communicate information for effective decision making and discovery. His work has led to novel visualization techniques in fields as diverse as computational fluid dynamics, atmospheric physics, medical imaging and cell biology. He received his postdoctoral training at Yale University and Ph.D in Computer Science from the University of Maryland Baltimore County.</p> <p>ADMISSION FEE<br/>Open to all to attend<br/>(Online registration is needed.

Though many expected Akin to take several wives, he and Yejide have always agreed: polygamy is not for them. But four years into their marriage--after consulting fertility doctors and healers, trying strange teas and unlikely cures--Yejide is still not pregnant. She assumes she still has time--until her family arrives on her doorstep with a young woman they introduce as Akin's second wife. Furious, shocked, and livid with jealousy, Yejide knows the only way to save her marriage is to get pregnant, which, finally, she does, but at a cost far greater than she could have dared to imagine.

Before opening their bookstore, they worked in campus ministry for the CCO (Coalition for Christian Outreach) in Pittsburgh, PA and served as an associate director of the Thomas Merton Center in Pittsburgh. Byron graduated from IUP with an MA in speech pathology in 1976 and later earned a Masters in Higher Education at Geneva College. He was recently awarded an honorary doctorate from Geneva College.</p> <p>Their ecumenical bookstore serves a wide variety of church groups, and others, and emphasizes resources which illustrate the integration of faith and learning, serving a robust vision of vocation, calling and serving God in the workaday world and encouraging social action for cultural renewal. He speaks widely about the transforming consequences of the gospel for all of life and has lead workshops on reading, applied theology, cultural engagement, the role of literature and the arts in Christian living, and social justice at national events such as Redeemer Presbyterian Church's Center for Faith &amp; Work in New York, Makoto Fujimura's IAM arts gatherings, the Q Ideas event, Parish Nursing conferences, and CCO's Jubilee. They offer off-site book displays at many denominational gatherings, clergy retreats, and church revitalization conferences.</p> <p>Byron has written for various publications, including Sojourners, Q Ideas, Comment, and the Center for Public Justice's Capitol Commentary. Even though committed to the old-school printed page, he enjoys using social media and blogs regularly about books in their newsletter, BookNotes, www.heartsandmindsbooks.com/booknotes</p> <p>Byron and Beth have three grown children, and are active at First Presbyterian Church, York, PA.</p> <p>We meet from 10am to noon, then go to a nearby restaurant for a no-host lunch.

A prominent university has begun to give preferences to high school graduates who come from lower socioeconomic communities. As a result, some graduates with higher GPAs and financial means are being turned away.<br/>2. Medicine: When does life really end? Does society have a responsibility to maintain, idefinitely, an individual on life support at the request of next-of-kin? Assuming the individual is either a child or has no medical directive, who makes that decision? Families? Doctors? Courts?<br/>3. Science: We know about GMOs in food production? What about GMOs for humans? The possibilities are endless and closer than we realize.</p> <p>Note: We may not be able to cover all three in our limited time.

Speaking regularly in front of a group helps you calm your nerves and communicate effectively.</p> <p><b>\\u201cPractice\\u201d Presentations for Other Audiences</b><br/>Everyone has different motivations for wanting to speak better. Maybe you want to hone your presentation skills for your career. Perhaps you want to be able to speak out in your volunteer organization. Maybe you want to complement your portfolio as an author, manager, or other professional with speaking gigs? Whatever the case, Toastmasters is a wonderful laboratory for you to practice your presentations and gain valuable feedback.</p> <p><b>Gain the Confidence and Courage to Lead</b><br/>Leadership and communication skills are intimately bound.

He will then dive into California bryology from an ecological and biogeographical perspective. Bryophytes have a unique suite of adaptations that allow them to live in many environments that vascular plants cannot. Because they're spore dispersed, they also exhibit biogeographic patterns that are quite different from those commonly seen in the seed plants. He will discuss basic principles of bryophyte ecology and biogeography in the context of the California flora, and also explore ongoing research into ecology and biogeography of California bryophytes.</p> <p>Ben Carter is Assistant Professor and director of the Sharsmith Herbarium at San Jose State University. He did his undergraduate work at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and earned a PhD from Berkeley studying bryophyte systematics. After graduating, he spent a year living on Santa Catalina Island and studying the Channel Island flora. He then spent several years on the east coast as a postdoctoral scholar at Duke University. His current interests include understanding the influence of microclimates on moss distributions and working with herbarium specimen data to understand broad biogeographic patterns across North America.</p> <p>Directions: From Foothill Expy., travel \\u00bd mile on San Antonio Rd. towards the Bay, cross Hillview and turn right into the driveway; library is on the left.

Do love to sketch? Do you love the Stanford University Museums? Would you like to come in contact directly with great architecture while using your talent in drawing? Heidi Noriko, drawing instructor will help you look carefully at perspective drawing interior architecture. What you would need to get started is a sketchbook and pencil for perspective drawing. For indoor drawing, museum policy requires one to draw only with pencil or colored pencils. No worries! Basic is beautiful. These simple tools will enable you to become a more refined artist. The class will be structured for all types of people from basic to expert. I will be sensitive to your needs.</p> <p>DIRECTIONS: To start, bring a sketchbook, pencils and eraser to The Anderson Collection at Stanford University. There are portable stools located at both museums.</p> <p>10:45 Meet at the entrance of The Anderson Collection at Stanford University.</p> <p>11:00 Instructor Introduction to today's course and friendly greetings. Shortly after this, the instructor Heidi Noriko will have a short talk the The Anderson Collection. We will first examine geometric shapes and then examine usage of how lines converge in the in the interior of modern architecture to start visualizing perspective drawing. How will you as an artist convey it's meaning through the usage of line, form, light and shadow?</p> <p>11:15 Warm up Gesture Drawings Gesture drawings are quick sketches identifying form basic geometric form. It is like an action drawing and like warming up your car, this is a good tool to get your creative juices working!</p> <p>12:45pm This time instead if figurative drawing it's focus is in converging lines to find perspective on paper. Focused Sketch/es until you think you are finished! By this time you are feeling what I call the creative adrenaline start to flow. We will finish a few drawings at the Anderson Collection and then move to the Cantor Arts Center for final drawings. Here you will definitely see a difference in how lines and geometry differs from modern to classic architecture. You will start to squeeze your beautiful and unique perception. If not, don't despair you have taken the plunge in this unique experience! I will stay until 1pm or a bit longer.</p> \", \"how_to_find_us\": \"The Anderson Collection at Stanford University is located at 314 Lomita Dr, Stanford, CA 94305.  10 maximum people are allowed to draw in a group setting at the museum.  \", \"visibility\": \"public\"}, {\"created\": 1525378633000, \"duration\": 10800000, \"id\": \"250423413\", \"name\": \"The Future of Energy Storage\", \"status\": \"upcoming\", \"time\": 1527210000000, \"local_date\": \"2018-05-24\", \"local_time\": \"18:00\", \"updated\": 1525388710000, \"utc_offset\": -25200000, \"waitlist_count\": 0, \"yes_rsvp_count\": 2, \"venue\": {\"id\": 24438450, \"name\": \"HanaHaus \", \"lat\": 37.44755935668945, \"lon\": -122.15955352783203, \"repinned\": false, \"address_1\": \"456 University Ave\", \"city\": \"Palo Alto \", \"country\": \"us\", \"localized_country_name\": \"USA\", \"zip\": \"\", \"state\": \"CA\"}, \"group\": {\"created\": 1328735015000, \"name\": \"German American Business Association (GABA NorCal)\", \"id\": 3258802, \"join_mode\": \"open\", \"lat\": 37.38999938964844, \"lon\": -122.06999969482422, \"urlname\": \"German-American-Business-Association-NorCal\", \"who\": \"GABA Enthusiasts\", \"localized_location\": \"Mountain View, CA\", \"region\": \"en_US\"}, \"link\": \"https://www.meetup.com/German-American-Business-Association-NorCal/events/250423413/\", \"description\": \"<p>Keeping the lights on with clean energy</p> <p>Imagine for a moment that we have built enough wind and solar power plants to supply 100 percent of the electricity a region like California or a country like Germany consumes in a year. The continuing rapid cost declines of wind and solar power generation assets make it possible that ambitious energy targets can be met at costs competitive with fossil fuels. However, experts agree, without energy storage it will be impossible to get beyond 80% renewable energy. The variable character of wind and solar power makes it impossible to guarantee sufficient supply of energy 24 hours a day. Energy storage goes far beyond the use in electric vehicles. It is the key to a transformation of the way we generate and consume electric energy. Besides enabling the replacement of fossil fuel power plants, storage has a wide variety of other benefits, for utilities, grid operators and private and commercial users. Our expert panel will discuss topics like:<br/>What is the roadmap for more storage integration? Germany vs California, what can we learn from each other?<br/>If the case for energy storage is so clear cut, why don\\u2019t we see more of it?

Speaking regularly in front of a group helps you calm your nerves and communicate effectively.</p> <p><b>\\u201cPractice\\u201d Presentations for Other Audiences</b><br/>Everyone has different motivations for wanting to speak better. Maybe you want to hone your presentation skills for your career. Perhaps you want to be able to speak out in your volunteer organization. Maybe you want to complement your portfolio as an author, manager, or other professional with speaking gigs? Whatever the case, Toastmasters is a wonderful laboratory for you to practice your presentations and gain valuable feedback.</p> <p><b>Gain the Confidence and Courage to Lead</b><br/>Leadership and communication skills are intimately bound.

Do love to sketch? Do you love the Stanford University Museums? Would you like to come in contact directly with some the greatest artists of our time while using your talent in drawing? Heidi Noriko, drawing instructor will help you look carefully at Manuel Neri's work. We will sketch with volume, line, creating solids and crystallizing intuitive emotion. What you would need to get started with a sketchbook and charcoal pencil for plein air drawing. For indoor drawing, museum policy requires one to draw only with pencil or colored pencils. No worries! Basic is beautiful. These simple tools will enable you to become a more refined artist. The class will be structured for all types of people from basic to expert. I will be sensitive to your needs. If you want to draw on your own in your own style... that's ok too! The class will introduce or re-introduce you to Neri's unique portrayal of humanity.</p> <p>DIRECTIONS: Bring a sketchbook, charcoal, pencils and eraser to The Anderson Collection at Stanford University. If you would like to bring a blanket to sit on or portable chair that's fine. We will start outside in front of the Anderson Collection. We will be working inside, also.</p> <p>12:45 Meet in front of The Anderson Collection Museum</p> <p>1:00 Instructor Introduction to today's course and friendly greetings Shortly after this, the instructor Heidi Noriko will have a short talk about The Anderson Collection and Neri Sculpture based on her direct experience as Ambassador to the Stanford Museums. We will examine usage of the anatomical and emotional experience. How is that translated into sculpture and more importantly how will you as an artist convey it's meaning through the usage of line, form, light and shadow?</p> <p>1:15 Warm up Gesture Drawings Gesture drawings are quick sketches identifying form. This enables the artist to find shape on paper. It is like an action drawing and like warming up your car, this is a good tool to get in tune with Neri's work to get your creative juices working!</p> <p>1:45pm Focused Sketch/es until you think you are finished! By this time you are feeling what I call the creative adrenelin start to flow. Perhaps you are really excited in the beginning and your gesture drawings are already in expression! You will start to squeeze your beautiful and unique perception of Neri's work. If not, don't despair you have taken the plunge in this unique experience! I will stay until 3pm or a bit longer.</p> \", \"how_to_find_us\": \"The Anderson Collection at Stanford University is located at 328 Lomita Dr, Stanford, CA 94305.  10 maximum people are allowed to draw in a group setting at the museum.

You are actually doing it unconsciously out of love for someone else in your family system. We follow patterns of our family or imitate our ancestors out of blind archaic love.</p> <p>When we have tried to change something and haven\\u2019t been successful, it is often because it is serving a purpose for our Family System. It is impossible to understand and heal this unless we are able to \\u201csee the entanglements\\u201d in our Family System. We are able to do this through the Family Constellation.</p> <p>Come and learn how to heal and have the loving relationship you have always wanted!</p> <p>* What are we going to do?<br/>In this workshop, I will give some explanations about how the systemic dynamics of the Family System affect our relationships. Then we will do many exercises to heal the blind loyalties or entanglements that we have with our Family System that are keeping us from finding and keeping a loving relationship.</p> <p>* Who is this workshop for?<br/>This workshop is for everyone.

Sigma cluster management is the core infrastructure of Alibaba that manages most online services. Through our in-house developed PouchContainer technology, Sigma forms the basis for the goal of managing the computers of Alibaba data centers as one computer. In this talk, we will introduce the goal and positioning of Alibaba cluster management system and business scenarios. We will also share the problems we have solved, the insights of our architecture design, as well as the challenges and opportunities we face and our future plans for the Alibaba cluster management.</p> <p>2. The engine of Sigma: the Sigma scheduler<br/>The sigma scheduler is a policy-rich, micro-topology-aware, workload-specific control plane component that places workload to the nodes. The scheduler needs to take into account individual and collective resource requirements, quality of service requirements, hardware/software/policy constraints, anti-affinity specifications, data locality, workload interference, and so on. The quality of the scheduler significantly impacts the overall cluster performance and utilization. In this talk, we will present the overall design principle of the sigma scheduler and its architecture. We will also explore some of the interesting functionalities that are designed to handle large scale low latency workload.</p> <p>3. PaddlePaddle Fluid: Elastic Deep Learning on Kubernetes<br/>Industrial deep learning requires significant computation power. Traditional management systems like SLURM, MPI, and SGE do not support elastic scheduling. A job that requires 100 nodes and submitted to a cluster with 99 idle nodes would have to wait for a long time and the cluster suffers from a low utilization. PaddlePaddle EDL introduces a scheduler that implements elastic scheduling. Our scheduler considers prioritization so it can elastically schedule all kinds of jobs, e.g., web server, log collector, data processor, and deep learning, running on a general-purpose cluster, and builds a highly efficient data pipeline. The third part of our work is to make PaddlePaddle supports fault-tolerant distributed training so that killing or starting processes of a training job doesn't stop it. On a bare-metal cluster shared with the academia, we observed ~91% of general utilization, which is times higher than the average number of 18% observed from MPI and SLURM clusters.</p> \", \"visibility\": \"public\"}, {\"link\": \"https://www.meetup.com/soccer-pickup-game-sf-peninsula/events/250348001/\", \"visibility\": \"public_limited\", \"group\": {\"created\": 1389044898000, \"name\": \"SF Bay Area Peninsula Pickup Soccer\", \"id\": 11866222, \"join_mode\": \"approval\", \"lat\": 37.4900016784668, \"lon\": -122.19999694824219, \"urlname\": \"soccer-pickup-game-sf-peninsula\", \"who\": \"Soccer players\", \"localized_location\": \"Redwood City, CA\", \"region\": \"en_US\"}, \"waitlist_count\": 0, \"yes_rsvp_count\": 6, \"duration\": 5400000, \"time\": 1526959800000, \"utc_offset\": -25200000, \"name\": \"Monday Night Pick Up Games\", \"id\": \"zddvqpyxhbcc\"}, {\"created\": 1520115532000, \"duration\": 3600000, \"id\": \"kdtxkpyxhbrb\", \"name\": \"Coffee and Community Sundays 1pm at Starbucks (490 El Camino Real, Redwood City)\", \"status\": \"upcoming\", \"time\": 1526241600000, \"local_date\": \"2018-05-13\", \"local_time\": \"13:00\", \"updated\": 1520115532000, \"utc_offset\": -25200000, \"waitlist_count\": 0, \"yes_rsvp_count\": 1, \"venue\": {\"id\": 25754488, \"name\": \"Starbucks Coffee\", \"lat\": 37.49033737182617, \"lon\": -122.23955535888672, \"repinned\": false, \"address_1\": \"490 El Camino Real, Redwood City, CA 94063\", \"city\": \"Redwood City\", \"country\": \"us\", \"localized_country_name\": \"USA\", \"zip\": \"94063\", \"state\": \"ca\"}, \"group\": {\"created\": 1352593881000, \"name\": \"The Humanist Connection: Serving Silicon Valley\", \"id\": 5788422, \"join_mode\": \"open\", \"lat\": 37.41999816894531, \"lon\": -122.16000366210938, \"urlname\": \"HumanistConnection\", \"who\": \"Humanists\", \"localized_location\": \"Stanford, CA\", \"region\": \"en_US\"}, \"link\": \"https://www.meetup.com/HumanistConnection/events/250563994/\", \"description\": \"<p>Sundays: 1pm-2pm<br/>Starbucks 490 El Camino Real, Redwood City, CA 94063</p> <p>Join your friends from the Humanist Connection for coffee, Conversation, and community on Sunday at 1pm at Starbucks (490 El Camino Real, Redwood City, CA 94063)!</p> <p>Looking forward to seeing you there,</p> <p>John Figdor<br/>Executive Director of the Humanist Connection</p> \", \"how_to_find_us\": \"Ask for the Humanists at the counter.\", \"visibility\": \"public\"}, {\"link\": \"https://www.meetup.com/SFBayAreaFurs/events/250497607/\", \"visibility\": \"public_limited\", \"group\": {\"created\": 1199221337000, \"name\": \"The Bay Area Furries Meetup Group\", \"id\": 913907, \"join_mode\": \"approval\", \"lat\": 37.349998474121094, \"lon\": -121.9800033569336, \"urlname\": \"SFBayAreaFurs\", \"who\": \"Furries\", \"localized_location\": \"Santa Clara, CA\", \"region\": \"en_US\"}, \"waitlist_count\": 0, \"yes_rsvp_count\": 2, \"time\": 1527899400000, \"utc_offset\": -25200000, \"name\": \"East Bay Furry Fridays At Round 1 Arcade\", \"id\": \"mrcgqmyxjbcb\"}, {\"created\": 1457557867000, \"duration\": 4500000, \"id\": \"fgpjrlyxhbmb\", \"name\": \"Monthly cofounder mixer: find your cofounder!\", \"status\": \"upcoming\", \"time\": 1525893300000, \"local_date\": \"2018-05-09\", \"local_time\": \"12:15\", \"updated\": 1458949034000, \"utc_offset\": -25200000, \"waitlist_count\": 0, \"yes_rsvp_count\": 46, \"venue\": {\"id\": 24124539, \"name\": \"TechCode\", \"lat\": 37.38199996948242, \"lon\": -122.08674621582031, \"repinned\": false, \"address_1\": \"1172 Castro St\", \"city\": \"Mountain View\", \"country\": \"us\", \"localized_country_name\": \"USA\", \"zip\": \"\", \"state\": \"CA\"}, \"group\": {\"created\": 1333751549000, \"name\": \"Startup Cofounders\", \"id\": 3620912, \"join_mode\": \"open\", \"lat\": 37.41999816894531, \"lon\": -122.12999725341797, \"urlname\": \"cofounder\", \"who\": \"Founders\", \"localized_location\": \"Palo Alto, CA\", \"region\": \"en_US\"}, \"link\": \"https://www.meetup.com/cofounder/events/250221717/\", \"description\": \"<p><b><i>A TechCode event\\u00a0sponsored by\\u00a0</i><i>SV Caf\\u00e9,\\u00a0SVSIAN and BACES</i></b></p> <p><i><br/></i></p> <p><b>Looking for a cofounder for your startup?</b></p> <p>Do you want to start a new business?

The first is on how we can promote longevity by Bernd Friedlander, DC, and the second is on health and well being by Luis Arrondo, DC, CABNN</p> <p>Promoting longevity, preventing aging diseases what we can do today<br/>Bernd Friedlander, DC</p> <p>Patients do not simply want to avoid disease, they want to be healthy. While US emergency rooms are extremely good at resolving a true acute-care crisis like getting hit by a car, the system does not get people healthy. For example, many of the most popular prescription drugs in the US today do not cure any disease, they simply reduce or mask symptoms, and have serious side effects (e.g.: statins - CoQ10 depletion and muscle pain, sometimes death; Reclast - kidney damage and jaw necrosis; SSRIs: suicide and homicide). [Ed: See \\\"Drug Muggers\\\" by pharmacist Suzy Cohen for a full list of nutrient depletion by prescription medicines].</p> <p>That is the vacuum into which SVHI, integrative, functional and German Biological Medicine are rapidly growing - because these more holistic approaches can get results.</p> <p>Rather than look at the macro level of a person aging and deteriorating under a series of crippling chronic degenerative diseases and risky expensive invasive procedures, true integrative medicine (like your auto mechanic) looks for root causes of problems that manifest in different ways. You may judge a tree by its fruit - but good results are due to many small things that go right. Thus wellness doesn't begin at the whole person level - it begins at the cellular level. As above (macro, the person) so below (micro, the cells and their components such as mitochondria and membranes).</p> <p>Longevity and regenerative abilities begin with having efficient mitochondria which provides energy to all cells. Maintaining a high metabolic rate has shown to increase life span, by increasing NAD+.</p> <p>Energy production can be increased by reducing things that get in the way of glucose oxidation, cellular respiration in the mitochondria, or thyroid hormone function. This list of things to reduce includes PUFAs (polyunsaturated fatty acids), lactic acid, serotonin, nitric oxide, tryptophan, estrogen. The steps to increase health and longevity will be discussed.</p> <p>Beyond illness and health: Well-being<br/>Luis Arrondo, DC, CABNN</p> <p>What if the attainment of health, as we commonly know it, is not an absolute?</p> <p>When is an illness itself a cure? What lies beyond simply being healthy?</p> <p>Join Doctor Luis Arrondo, DC, as he explores hidden connections between health, illness, and our well-being: our sense of self and purpose. His talk is based on the concepts and clinical experiences he shares in his revealing book Wolves, Gardens, and Chocolate.<br/>Discover how a deeper understanding of the interconnection between our tissues, organs, systems, mind and life experiences can help to break through obesity issues, many chronic illnesses, increase energy, and lead to a life more satisfyingly lived. The wisdom of ancient cultures, Greek, Roman and others, are discussed in the light of what they can teach us about health and healing.<br/>Based on over 20 years of clinical experiences with patients and as well as extensive medical research, he outlines connections between our molecular, biomechanical, systemic, psychological as well as spiritual dynamics. Learn they are intertwined in ways that can help us to move beyond frustrating barriers to chronic health issues.<br/>\\\"Fix the body to fix the fat\\\" is something Dr. Arrondo tells his patients, and works with, to help sustained weight loss occur without hunger or discomfort. He also teaches them how to lose weight by eating chocolate - twice a day!</p> <p>Cost: $10 per person; $60 per year</p> \", \"visibility\": \"public\"}, {\"created\": 1516744784000, \"duration\": 3600000, \"id\": \"stbmgpyxhbqb\", \"name\": \"FUN, safe and effective WORKOUT with personal attention\", \"rsvp_limit\": 6, \"status\": \"upcoming\", \"time\": 1526133600000, \"local_date\": \"2018-05-12\", \"local_time\": \"07:00\", \"updated\": 1516744784000, \"utc_offset\": -25200000, \"waitlist_count\": 0, \"yes_rsvp_count\": 1, \"venue\": {\"id\": 25702732, \"name\": \"I AM FITNESS\", \"lat\": 37.50259017944336, \"lon\": -122.21078491210938, \"repinned\": false, \"address_1\": \"489 Seaport Blvd\", \"city\": \"Redwood City\", \"country\": \"us\", \"localized_country_name\": \"USA\", \"zip\": \"94063\", \"state\": \"ca\"}, \"group\": {\"created\": 1516586301000, \"name\": \"Redwood City Fitness Meetup\", \"id\": 27234670, \"join_mode\": \"open\", \"lat\": 37.459999084472656, \"lon\": -122.2300033569336, \"urlname\": \"Redwood-City-Fitness-Meetup\", \"who\": \"Members\", \"localized_location\": \"Redwood City, CA\", \"region\": \"en_US\"}, \"link\": \"https://www.meetup.com/Redwood-City-Fitness-Meetup/events/250516035/\", \"description\": \"<p>\\u2022 What we'll do<br/>If you're looking for a FUN, safe, effective WORKOUT you've found the right place.

He's also produced three full-length CDs for other artists.</p> <p>Born and raised in California, he and his wife are currently building a place for artists to find refuge and inspiration in Big Bend, Texas. Playing guitar, singing and writing songs since he was a boy, his music uniquely combines percussive (hammer) guitar techniques with bottleneck, tapping, harmonica, and a rich baritone voice.</p> <p>Whether documentaries of real world characters met traveling, flights of guitar fascination, or detailed cinematic inspiration, Sprawl's songs come from a lifelong far, wide, and deep creative process. His sensibility is that of a world traveler grown from a kid schooled in Southern California in the 60's and 70's film and music culture. The scope of his songwriting breaks barriers with a complex, intricate, sound linking our humanity with his thoughtfully crafted lyrics.

Our next event is on Sun. May 13 starting at 10 AM and running until 10 PM.

Put your money in the red donation cup on the table between the door and the whiteboard.</p> <p>We play mostly recent and classic Eurogames, the kind of games that are hot or ranked high on boardgamegeek. But we also play many other sorts of tabletop games, including family games, Ameritrash, and wargames. Here's a geeklist (<a href=\\\"https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/237923/games-played-bay-area-games-day-159-february-11-20\\\" class=\\\"linkified\\\">https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/237923/games-played-bay-area-games-day-159-february-11-20</a>) of what got played at the February event. Attendance is around 40-50 people, so it's easy to find players for most kinds of games.</p> <p>We welcome newcomers to gaming, and families with kids.</p> <p>Note that Games Day usually continues past the library's weekend closing time of 7 PM.

We talked a bunch about local ecology, as well as sharing stories about our various paths into Permaculture, and also talked about the Native/Invasive Plant debate. The new start and end times seemed to work well, so we'll continue with those, see below.</p> <p>It looks like some of us have the book, Miraculous Abundance, already, so go ahead and start reading, if that's the case. To give others the chance to get it, we'll wait another week to start discussing it, but for Tuesday we'll read these articles on Hedgerows in North America:</p> <p><a href=\\\"http://www.resilience.org/stories/2014-11-19/where-do-we-find-beauty-in-a-landscape/\\\"><a href=\\\"http://www.resilience.org/stories/2014-11-19/where-do-we-find-beauty-in-a-landscape/\\\" class=\\\"linkified\\\">http://www.resilience.org/stories/2014-11-19/where-do-we-find-beauty-in-a-landscape/</a></a></p> <p><a href=\\\"http://www.resilience.org/stories/2015-02-03/just-what-is-a-hedgerow-a-few-notes-on-history-form-and-function/\\\"><a href=\\\"http://www.resilience.org/stories/2015-02-03/just-what-is-a-hedgerow-a-few-notes-on-history-form-and-function/\\\" class=\\\"linkified\\\">http://www.resilience.org/stories/2015-02-03/just-what-is-a-hedgerow-a-few-notes-on-history-form-and-function/</a></a></p> <p><a href=\\\"http://www.resilience.org/stories/2015-03-19/hedgerow-hypotheticals-our-cities-and-suburbs-need-hedgerows-too/\\\"><a href=\\\"http://www.resilience.org/stories/2015-03-19/hedgerow-hypotheticals-our-cities-and-suburbs-need-hedgerows-too/\\\" class=\\\"linkified\\\">http://www.resilience.org/stories/2015-03-19/hedgerow-hypotheticals-our-cities-and-suburbs-need-hedgerows-too/</a></a></p> <p><a href=\\\"http://www.resilience.org/stories/2017-03-02/trees-on-the-edge/\\\"><a href=\\\"http://www.resilience.org/stories/2017-03-02/trees-on-the-edge/\\\" class=\\\"linkified\\\">http://www.resilience.org/stories/2017-03-02/trees-on-the-edge/</a></a></p> <p>Okay, I know that last one is on Irish hedgerows, but it's still relevant.</p> <p>Hedgerows are a major element in Permaculture Design, for some regions. I see them as long, narrow Food Forests, and very underused in California, which mostly sees them as a repository of Native pollinator plants. While they certainly can be that, and those are very important aspects of them, they can stack so many more functions than those, like food, fodder, mulch, building materials, medicinals, windbreaks, beauty, habitat, travel corridors, and much more.</p> <p>Also, she goes into the Native/Exotic/Invasive conversation, some, which we have mostly steered clear of in this space, although it's a critical one in the field of Permaculture Design and Ecology. Tao Orion's book, Beyond the War on Invasives is a great introduction to how the global industry of restoration ecology interfaces with the global movement of Permaculture Design. They are not necessarily mutually exclusive, I know Permaculturists who are also Nativists and Eradicationists, and also the reverse, but as the money trail from Big Chem to the Native Plant movement becomes more public, a lot more folks are asking questions about what we're doing and how we're doing it.</p> <p>For the summer, we'll be reading Miraculous Abundance, One Quarter Acre, Two French Farmers, and Enough Food to Feed the World, by Perrine and Charles Herv\\u00e9-Gruyer, available from Chelsea Green Publishing. I'm thinking to supplement this with readings from Lean Logic, by David Fleming, also from Chelsea Green. Chelsea Green is having a big sale, right now, and lots of books are on very nice discount, including Lean Logic. Anything you don't see on sale can be made on sale by signing up for their newsletter, which gives you 25% off of your first order and advance notice of new releases and sales. We'll wait a couple of weeks on Miraculous Abundance, to give y'all a chance to order it, then start reading it close to the end of July.</p> <p>Also, we're going to try starting at 6pm and ending at 7:30pm, in an effort to accommodate folks' schedules. Always okay to stick around after we formally break, of course.</p> <p>If you have things that are relevant to the topic, and to Permaculture in general, please bring them along. Although Permaculture is a very large tent, please do self-facilitate on this, and save things which are clearly better-suited to other forums for those other forums, If in doubt, bring it along and ask! I know lots of us like shopping at that river-named everything-fast-and-cheap-megastore, online. We're a Convenient, Cheap and Now culture, and they played a big role in getting us that way. That said, <i>please </i>support our local bookstores when buying books for our book groups. Books, Inc (Mountain View, Palo Alto) can get books in quickly, if they're not already on their shelves. Other good bookstores are The Linden Tree (Los Altos), Leigh's (Sunnyvale) and Kepler's (Menlo Park), as well as some nice used book stores. Have a local bookstore you like? Let me know! If it's really important to you to shop online, consider ordering directly from the publisher. Lots of our books come from Chelsea Green Publishing, and they could use our support.</p> <p>\\u2022 We'll be using the same guidelines as the Transition Caf\\u00e9s:</p> <p>\\u2022 Whoever shows up are the right people- Whenever it starts is the right time</p> <p>\\u2022 Speak when you are moved to speak</p> <p>\\u2022 The conversation gets to go where it wants to go</p> <p>\\u2022 Pauses in conversation are good, they allow information to sink in, thoughts to happen, and quieter people to have a chance to speak</p> <p>\\u2022 Silent listening is fine, you do not need to speak if you do not wish to</p> <p>\\u2022 The \\\"Law of Mobility\\\": if you feel like you are neither learning nor contributing, you may use your mobility to find a place in which you are doing so</p> <p>\\u2022 Bring friends, if we overpopulate the venue, we'll figure something else out</p> <p>\\u2022 If you are able, please buy stuff from the venues.

We struggle to lock in a permanent stamp of approval that is unachievable. This \\u201cproblem of self-esteem\\u201d is both a part of the human dilemma in general and at the center of Western culture in particular. Mindfulness shifts your perspective from outside-in to inside-out: self-worth arises by cultivating qualities that make it possible to embrace all parts of yourself, just as you are. This cultivation invites your inherent worth or Buddha nature to come to the surface. From an open, undefended position, you\\u2019re able to be truly present for yourself, others, and the experience of life.</p> <p>COURSE LEVELS:<br/>This course is open to all practitioners.
